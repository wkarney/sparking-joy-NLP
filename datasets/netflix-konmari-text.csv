 My mission is to spark joy in the world through tidying The KonMari method is unique because I organize by category rather than by location In the KonMari method we tidy five categories in a specific order When you have young children maintaining a tidy household is a struggle In this episode we meet a couple who have two young children and are struggling to keep their house tidy Rachel and Kevin The cluttered house seems to be affecting their relationship as well I would like to help this couple focus on what matters most to them time with their family Big umbrellas are really great Oh I see This is the kids room It must be hard to find things in here I think I can make this easier to use Was that planned Please be careful What are boobies The baby s way of saying breastfeeding I see Even my house gets cluttered sometimes Secret Does this clutter stress you out They are tired time for a nap Okay then So would you like to try it with me Okay we re finished Thank you very much Thank you I m grateful for you saying that What is your impression of this family I feel they are a warm and loving family the moment I entered the house The kids are so cute as well So cute They really are soothing You re absolutely right I think this house will become even more lovely It s lovely now of course but even more so I know things will be better I m looking forward to it So from here you will choose what you will keep You will only keep items that spark joy for you Do you know what it feels like when you spark joy You feel it when you hold a puppy or when you wear your favorite outfit It s a warm and positive feeling That s how it feels when something sparks joy Some of you may not know how that feels yet but please do not worry Your sensitivity to joy will be honed as you progress through the tidying process Wow this is heavy When folding it s important to convey love to your clothes from the palms of your hands By doing this you will start to like folding clothes We will store these standing in the drawer You should tuck in the sleeves first You should fold that back once Your folding will end up smoother with the gap Oh my God I m excited Like reading a book it s a habit to fold clothes with my children I do scold them You brought a lot of stuff today Yes I did I just brought boxes from my house I figured that today you d need to store little things Miscellaneous items include everything except clothes books documents and sentimental items I always use boxes when tidying miscellaneous items By using boxes you can compartmentalize the drawers neatly Yes Kevin will tidy the garage What category of things do you have in here YWill you give us a general idea In that case let s take everything out of here as well When you tidy your garage you should take everything out Then sort the items into categories If you encounter sentimental items while tidying I recommend that you address them last when your sensitivity to joy has become sufficiently heightened In my garage Just my Christmas decorations Let s keep moving along These cords are all tangled Do you wish that you had more personal items in your house Yeah It s so beautiful Today we are apart since I am working so this made me a bit jealous Wow I miss him In fact if I m really exhausted I ll just go to sleep While you are tidying it may seem like things are more cluttered than before But there s no need to worry By following the process step by step there will always be an end to tidying This is good Rachel and Kevin have a strong grasp of what it means to spark joy So with that we re moving on to the final category sentimental items Sentimental items have many categories For example memorabilia such as old letters or photos Let s take the sentimental things into the house That reminds me I wanted to tell you one more thing about storage So you put it in there so that it s easy to see Please sit here Thank you You said you are doing your own laundry but how often does your helper come I m so happy to hear that Wow it s so different I can feel the spirit of this bedroom Everything you have is so cute It s like a whole different closet It feels so different in here This is complete And finally the garage And the garage I like the feeling in this space Both you Rachel and Kevin you worked on your entire house this time You had quite the experience Thank you It was a lot of work but it was motivating knowing what the end was gonna be I m so happy I m so happy Through this process of tidying with Rachel and Kevin I reaffirmed my feelings that indeed couples can deepen their ties through tidying 
 Ah She looks excited I m so excited because I love mess It s a never ending battle to fight the clutter Oh I want things to be more simple I don t know how to fix it With the baby coming it s gonna be more chaos Oh my God We have too much stuff Hello I m Marie Kondo My mission is to spark joy in the world through cleaning Ching Best selling author and world renowned tidying expert Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring the world to choose joy with the KonMari Method The KonMari Method is unique because I organize by category rather than by location In the KonMari Method we tidy five categories in a specific order First is clothing I can t reach Next is books Giving them a little shake and wake them up Then paper I can t do the papers The largest category is komono Komono is kitchen bathroom and garage Everything miscellaneous Finally sentimental items It s kinda hard to let it go cause I really like this one This is kinda hard I don t want to just you know dump it But I want to be thoughtful about it From the moment she set foot in our house she had this presence to her She wants to see this place turned around Marie brought a whole bunch of joy upon our home This is amazing You re so cute I love you You re so cute I love you too These are like happy happy tears Thank you for what you ve brought to our home really Mushu where are you Kitty kitty kitty I do not see Mushu Oh no That window was open Okay Mushu here boy Here kitty kitty kitty Mushu Moosh okay boy come here Hello sweetie Come here Atta Come on Up we go up we go Alright gotcha Come on My name is Wendy Akiyama And I m Ron Akiyama We inherited the house in Raised our children here But we are now empty nesters But now the clutter it prevents me from having what I would call a normal retirement So I want Marie Kondo s help to actually maximize our enjoyment in this house Ditto everything she just said Cause I m her husband Ron s family moved here in My parents bought the house on the street down below at the same time that they were here Ended up marrying the boy next door Literally Yep We ve been married for What did I Forty two years Forty two Seventy six Yeah years So you know we ve gotten to the point where you know even if I come home and sit here and we don t say one word to each other he s just watching TV and I fall asleep it s a great relationship We don t feel pressured to Oh how was your day Oh how was your day You know it s there s just no pressure I feel like talking I ll talk I don t wanna talk I m not gonna talk Y o u know And there s no Well why aren t you talking to me You know so this is a great time for us to tackle something new like this where we re both going to be involved together What do you think It is Okay I have worked with many couples who wanted to re evaluate their life after their children have left home I have every confidence that if Ron and Wendy progress step by step they will be able to discover what s truly important in their life Which one Which one is it Oh it s this one Today are people of Japanese descent Oh really The outside looks a little Japanese That s very Japanese But there s no name plate Hi Hey Nice to meet you Nice to meet you I m Marie Yes Oh yes I know I am Wendy and this is my son Russell Hi Marie nice to meet you What was your name Iida It s Marie Kondo Marie Kondo Kondo Perfect We re Akiyamas Yeah we know Little bit Yeah I know a little bit English All I m saying is this job is gonna be what is it taihen It s okay Yeah my husband is here somewhere He ll be here in a minute He might be in the back I think he s in the backyard He might be in the backyard yes Oh Speak of the devil Oh gosh there you are Perfect This is Ron Hi nice to meet you I m Marie Yes I recognize your face from from YouTube So I would love to get a little bit of a tour inside your home if that s okay My name is Russell um and part of the reason why I am here is to help my mom because I think that there is a little bit of hesitation and concern for my dad about the daunting mountain of things my parents are gonna have to go through But you know even though he s a man of few words you know being able to have an activity like this with my mom he and my mom can get to know each other in this new process Cleaning the house was definitely Wasn t my priority but it would definitely be hers I m of the subscription to happy wife happy life so I I support whatever it takes to have a clean house if that makes Mama happy So I m just not in it because I don t know what it entails yet so let s see what happens here Okay so master bedroom Marie And then this is what we re dealing with here Baseball cards Marie Baseball card Those boxes all used to be white So all of these belong to your husband Yes the kids worked with my husband collected cards so this is the end result Ron is really perfectly willing to have things be status quo And maintaining the status quo actually does inhibit you from being creative and having um different approaches to solving the problems in your life If you re satisfied with the status quo then nothing s gonna change because you don t want change So I hope it s never too late to teach old dogs new tricks This is not everything Marie There s There s much more More clothes Yes Yes Oh you wanna see that next Yeah So this used to be a bedroom with a bed in it I see a lot of clothes with tags still on There s lots of things with tags yes And one of the things I would like to see for her retirement if we can transform this room into her office And I d love to see the one last place we have clothes Yeah there s actually two more rooms to look at in here Okay this is Russell s old room Ah Those are all mine This is my little brother s room And there s more in the closet The disorganization is stressful I try to just bury it not think about it to live with floor to ceiling boxes and to have a whole room of clothing that is just kinda thrown over things We can t find stuff and that does bother me And I think that getting that organized will help you know to make this feel like the home that I really would like to have So this way is the rumpus room please Amazing is this an activity room I d say an activity room A room where you watch TV you play games and this is the Christmas collection which I ve been trying to figure out how to put away So just wondering Christmas materials in the living room and all of this that s it right No and the kitchen And the bathroom And there s some nutcrackers that are still out yeah My love of Christmas started when I was a little girl My mom she was the one who actually made it really special for us as we were growing up and I wanted to do the same for my children Decorations were really important To me that was a big deal because now you know Christmas is coming And having the house you know decorated for Christmas just makes me happy It s nice You have a lot of memorabilia keepsakes in here Yes Yes yes Oh okay We re gonna go look at the garage next Yeah After you Go ahead Oh At least there s room for you to walk Garage There is room Oh there you are I didn t expect him up there Yeah that s Mushu and Mulan This is where a lot of everything ended up Yes We have no idea on how many boxes are in the garage and what s in them For most of its life the garage has been a clutter And we have three generations of belongings in this house It began with Ron s mom and dad They brought their belongings from their previous home And now we have our children s items which are still in this house and Ron s items and my items I do think that it will take a significant amount of time going through all this But you will finish Yes Okay That s what I want to hear Can I get a high five Marie Yes Here we go We re on So just as I introduced myself to you today I always also introduce myself to the house I love that I love that I never thought of talking to our house We should We should talk more to our house Yes Yes this is a good spot to do that And asking our house to cooperate with us That s great I love that Should we do Can we do that Can we kneel on the floor Can you do seiza Like this The Japanese proper way of sitting I don t think so If you can t that s okay Were you able to greet it Yes I was Okay When tidying your clothes you will take everything out and create one big pile This may seem like a hassle but please do not skip this step Only by creating one big pile are you able to see how much clothing you actually have You will also be shocked at the amount of clothing you have By experiencing this shock you will finally be able to decide what items are truly necessary for you I ll do this bit You really do own a load of jackets Yeah I do That s my weak point It just makes me feel good that I have em I think it ll make you feel good to get the space back too Oh sorry Excuse me Here you go now drawers There s truly a lot here So how long did it take about an hour Just about I m going to be honest with you This is the biggest pile I ve seen of all my clients Yay I win I don t know if that s how this works Yay For me clothes are a passion an obsession recreation Retail therapy is definitely something I m guilty of using And you know whenever Ron and I would fight shopping was a diversion it was a way to you know just calm down de stress Um Maybe you know hit Ron where it hurts in his pocketbook I know Holy cow Ron This is pretty bad He s working really hard Holy moly He is And just to to clarify or to keep fresh in my mind the object isn t necessarily to throw everything away it s to be it s like almost like Correct me if I m wrong like reacquaint yourself with your belongings What I really want you to ask yourself is if it s something you really want to take into your future Yes Yeah So your homework for this week is to finish sorting through all of your clothes Okay great Thank you very much Thank you I m kind of an old school macho kinda guy and this isn t something that I normally would do But um Wendy s kind of overwhelmed It s kind of unfair that her pile is three or four times what my pile is But my thing is baseball cards so I m pretty sure I m gonna get the crack of the whip for that I love having all of this I would not just take the whole mountain and just chuck it out I really love what I have I love clothing But to put it everything all in one pile I ve never done that before and I ve never seen the accumulation of everything that I own that s clothing So now I am overwhelmed I m gonna probably keep this one cause again I like the colors and it s really soft and comfortable so yes We will keep that one I m starting from the bottom just throwing everything down I like it I love florals so we will probably be keeping that one This is really heavy under Okay I can t pull it out When I was little I would make paper dolls and just design clothing for them piles and piles of clothing and keep changing them And so as I grew older I became the paper doll I still like to look at clothes I still like to try them on and um this is really hard for me to do Okay I like that one too The anxiety part is trying to understand what I have so that I can use it Seen the top of the bed yet Um no I m keeping a lot Well yeah I figured I have to make it go down I hope the next time I see Marie that this is gone Are we just throwing this in a bag Yes Okay Let s just get the process done You can walk when you get to Heaven so let s hurry up Hi Hello Marie Good to see you Iida good to see you Hello again How are you guys Good It s hot hot hot It got really hot quite suddenly I ve been taking out Lots of gomi Things that we let go that are Should be trash and things that we re letting go that are gonna be donated are all still piling up down here I had no idea there was an extra room in there There s a bathroom there believe it or not See look at it There s a lot There s a lot It s a large pile Again But this time these are things that are going right You want to see upstairs and I ll show you how we completed our homework Yes please show me So we ll start here This is where we had everything piled Wow It s wonderful You worked so hard I did it I did it I got rid of a lot You know it was easy on that one Yeah lotta bags have gone So in here sweaters was really huge too Now that you ve tackled your clothes what kind of effect has it had on the way you shop When I go through my emails that come from all my favorite stores and I m going delete delete de I m not even opening the emails Even when it s a sale Big difference Yes Yes yes So you ve worked so hard on the tidying clothes I would love to move on Okay Christmas decorations How do you feel looking at all of this Well right now I don t feel really good looking at all of them but once they re organized into their own little cases it just makes me feel really good that I have them What do you think of the quantity though Does this feel right for you Yes because we have a big house and I like to have Christmas like in the three main entertaining rooms So I feel I need this many in order to bring Christmas to all three of the main rooms I don t recommended putting things in plastic bags like this It starts to look like gomi or trash Satsuki these are Christmas decorations And this one This one too Here you go My little girls love Christmas as well But I don t think they share the same enthusiasm as Wendy Here are some tips for tidying Christmas decorations Create one big pile Hold each item one by one Only keep the ones that spark joy I m sure there are a lot of families who use Christmas to decorate together In those situations it would be great if everyone did it together Hey Satsuki Does this spark joy Yeah Yes It sparks joy Here are some tips on storing seasonal decorations First do not store them in trash bags Put the decorations in a box For example store them in clear containers like this That way it ll be easier to see what s inside So this morning Ron and I got up at five o clock in the morning and we piled it on top of all the sofas so that we have more room here to work Wendy is starting to take apart Christmas And the infamous nutcrackers are where she is Goodbye Not necessarily where she s starting but I don t know if you remember but that was super full She s got these clear bins that I think she was talking to Marie about Here s two bins that she s already done I really I love Christmas and I do realize it was it was a little overboard here you know with things just in every It almost looked like I was selling the stuff So I learned that it didn t have to be that extreme to look really festive So um I m gonna change the way I decorate this year Wendy started off with Mount Wendy because the clothes was probably the most daunting thing that she had And so the cards was gonna Are gonna be my Mount Ron Found Marino s rookie card And John Elway s rookie card Baseball cards is something that me and the kids have been collecting for over year I ve been collecting for longer than that but with the kids over years Going through this process it has made me think about things more about whether does it make sense for me to keep it or does it make sense for me to treasure it or does it make sense for me to say thanks and get rid of it I never really thought that I would think the way I m thinking about baseball cards now the way I am If I really think about it I only need to keep ten percent of it Oh let s see How is he doing Aww He actually conked out I m looking I mean look at all this carnage here Believe it or not he has it under control It doesn t look like it but he does So we re gonna do the fall stuff over here right Yes Clumsy Wen I know well it wasn t anything important There are a lot of things out here There s some more Hi How are you I m so dirty How are you lida Come in Come in Hi good to see you Good seeing you Yeah I know I m not So you wanna see the garage Absolutely Of course I can t wait You can see the other side I know Isn t it amazing Konnichiwa Hello Ron Hey Konnichiwa So did you guys discover anything new about each other while you were tidying this garage Well what d you call me Ron Gasa gasa I m gasa gasa Gasa gasa He slows me down I kinda make him hurry up Ron s reaction to the thought of going into this project was like I guess what most men would Like What s wrong with the way things are right now You know If it isn t broke don t fix it But now he s enjoying it I think he s enjoying the results His creativity level just jumped you know it just went onto the moon He s like Why don t we do this why don t we do that We re working together to accomplish something that we think is definitely gonna be life changing I think since Marie s come here from the beginning to now we re totally we look at this differently Spark joy that really is a a real thing It actually brought about changes that we really didn t expect That s true That s true Truly Truly There actually is a side bonus to all of this and the side bonus is that um we re working together Right are you putting small big how are you doing it Just anyway you can but obviously you don t wanna put smalls on the bottom It s kinda fun actually What re you gonna do up there Cause that s all gonna come out I think we still wanna put some of the photographs and stuff up there From de cluttering and cleaning and working with Marie that Ron and Wendy are actually are working together on a project like this it s kinda cool Okay So I think we re done We can see the endgame right now And before it was kinda like How are we gonna do it Because there was just so much stuff in there But now we ve made tremendous progress and we re gonna continue And so my motivation is I never want to have to do this again We estimated what bags of trash have left this house A hundred and fifty Okay so where do you want to start Top shelves or bottom shelves Um Probably top shelves Yeah Yeah So Is that hair What does it say Russell Yeah it s Russell s hair First haircut First haircut Okay Nana kept that Holy crap This is April Does that even look like me That s you Yep I mean it almost looks like Russell Wow There s gonna be a lotta things that we re gonna find I know that are precious to us and we have to come up with a way to store them What we need to do is make a pile of photos that we re gonna come back to When tidying photos you must believe in your ability to know what sparks joy for you Let s go through each one one by one This one sparks joy This one doesn t This one does This one doesn t If you have similar photos keep the one that sparks the most joy Photos can be stored in a box My recommendation is to store them in an album This makes it easier to enjoy the memories Some places to store your albums are on bookshelves and coffee tables Please find a spot that sparks joy for you Okay We kinda were thinking of the stages and the sentimental was definitely a part of the stage that I was looking forward to honestly cause I really wanted to see some of this old stuff that I either have never seen or haven t seen for a long time and by a long time I m talking Fifty years Yeah fifty years I m pretty sure this was my father s Hmm When I started looking into it this is December th That was Pearl Harbor And then he begins to tell that they were gonna be interned at Santa Anita Racetrack And what happened to them you know right after the break of World War II So This is an item that should be cherished Yeah Absolutely There s a lot of memories in this house There s a lot of emotional stuff that we found that took us back You know we ve found more things that have brought value to us that are worth absolutely nothing to anybody else but to us they re worth a ton And we wouldn t have found that stuff um if we didn t start this process Did you dust these Yeah more or less but Don t you know you re gonna create more work than you want if you start doing that There s the door Um Konnichiwa Hi Konnichiwa How are you Hello Hi I think we re gonna show you the garage first Oh great idea Wendy san Marie How are you Good Good to see you This is a completely different room Yes even from last week right You did this all in a week Yeah yes Amazing Those are some dolls I found in a box How do you say doll Kokeshi Kokeshi dolls Morioka Sendai Mizusawa the reindeer Look at all the tiny ones They re so cute Aren t they cute We had no idea these existed It was hidden in one of the cabinets It brings me joy just to see this in the garage that you have space to display this now All through this process I was stepping back going How did we let it get to this Or How did this happen Or How did that happen And man I can t leave anything around anymore I mean it s like Why s that in the middle of the living room Why is that there Why is that there So it s definitely changing us and I have to say it s for the better Here s my office Can you believe it Look at this Wendy san So see We did it And then here s workspace here workspace there Ron and I we thought You know what This would be a good place to store the photo boxes What happened to all the shoes Ah Oh I ll show you We moved everything Alright so here now we have more of the clothing all in the Mount Wendy room I know little by little this is turning into being a walk in closet Okay so here is Ron s space Ah Workspace I love it This is all that s left after the big mountain The whole KonMari philosophy and everything I think really has played a key into the way that we re looking at stuff Yeah I think this is a very good volume that you can calmly look through Yes There s a value to our possessions that maybe I didn t feel that I had before So if I have um ten baseball cards as opposed to baseball cards I m gonna treasure those ten baseball cards more than if I had That s really huge coming from him because really for him to cross over you know into the light is huge it s huge Okay yeah so I just want to say that Ah look how clean this room is And so here s a picture If you stand right here this is the view How many years ago was this This is probably a good years ago Yeah Really just everything that has been placed here it s just transformed the feeling in this whole room It s so different Oh thank you Yeah we feel it too I can feel a change in the atmosphere of the house It feels lighter it feels more positive And actually to me is probably the first step in de stressing and moving forward you know into our retirement years I m just struggling to find the right words because I m so moved right now Because these past six weeks both of you have so seriously confronted not just your possessions but your own lives and yourselves as well and I m just so moved That s what I m you know most proud about her She s a good partner We did put in some long hours some days So on our very first day together I asked What is our ideal vision for your life together And Ron you mentioned happy wife happy life Do you think you ve accomplished that Yeah I think we accomplished happy wife happy life She s my girl she s always been my girl she ll always be my girl There were times where it was a little hard and um we came through it Here we go guys First game of pool in I don t know how many years He partnered with me on this and you know went all in And that is you know really something You know thanks I was really really thankful for that Oh my God I do not believe that This really has been a fun thing for us to do We ve laughed a lot He s sandbagging me I think that both of us we have gotten closer and it s brought a lot of joy in my life Oh my gosh these flowers are beautiful Look at those And now we re thinking there really isn t any other task that we couldn t do together Congratulations for successfully completing the KonMari Method of tidying You ve graduated We graduated Yay Oh my gosh I m very very happy with the results and um I can honestly say that it s gonna change the way I view possessions it s gonna change the way Actually the way that I you know proceed with the rest of my life

mean we re doing the best we can because you know it s a smaller space than what we re used to But we feel stressed at home because of the clutter It s an unnecessary pressure and stress for them to live tight like this It s just this one big cycle of jumbled scatterbrain That s a big red flag I don t want to live like that So I need help We need help When my family and I moved from Japan to the United States we only brought things that truly sparked joy for us For the Mersier family their new challenge is to downsize the things that they own so it will fit in their new home It s so cute Oh

I ll say Where is it and she ll tell us Ah I m sure it s a lot when you get asked all the time right Oh my And they don t like my mood because sometimes I m like Katrina bears a lot of the weight of keeping the house organized and helping us to keep it organized because we don t know where things are It s the real daily struggle I ll be home alone and I ll just say Dang where is this I need this now And I say Mm texting Mom Gotta text Mom And it will be to a certain point where I just spam her phone until she answers That s how much I depend on her Have you ever seen such a thing Every day I

think it would be best if they have a dresser of their own too eventually Yes The other half of the room it is also cluttered There s no space It s hard for me to feel like this an actual home So they have so much in the room because when I organize it they don t keep it organized It s okay Mom It s cause Cause I keep trying You re trying hard I know Yeah like she organizes our things but we don t know how to keep them organized so then when we mess it up it just hurts her and it hurts me too cause I feel bad after I mess it up so I feel like I m to blame cause I m the mom and Mom is supposed to create the memories Mom is supposed to make home home I hold that near and dear and I own it It s my responsibility to do the laundry go to the grocery store wash dishes cook and I ve got to clean the kids room But I feel like I m failing in that area Which is not okay with me I want to create a home that they will remember you know I want them to remember where they had peace of mind and they

Mama I m okay Mama Mama It ll be okay It seems like Katrina manages all the family s belongings However through the KonMari Method of tidying I would like to teach the family how to be responsible with their belongings So we re gonna begin the tidying process from here but there s something that I like to do before we begin I always like to introduce myself to the house Wow Okay great This is a very nice home Thank you So the first step is clothes Okay Alright Let s do that First let s begin with making a big pile of all the clothes that you own Snuggy Oh my Ugh You got a lot of clothes Actually Yeah he has way more than me No You always are like I don t have anything to wear That s cause they re always dirty All his stuff is out We did it Woof How do you feel looking at your piles Seeing that much for her I m definitely not setting her up to win at life He s she s We could have started this at age five just like you Not too late never too late Mm hmm That s it So from here we ll be selecting the clothes that you want to keep and what you want to let go Only keep clothes that sparks joy for you Yes Clothes that you ve decided to let go thank it for all that it s been doing for you Gratitude Yeah Gratitude is very important Yeah Done so much good for me I thank you for that You know your girl isn t gonna get rid of you How have I not worn you before You give me so much joy Oh my goodness For kids you guys don t have drawers so I have something to recommend to you Alright Okay We re gonna create storage out of these shoe boxes but it s only temporary for now In an empty box stack them vertically like this Oh There we go Wow That s unbelievable So you had put clothing racks in your room right Yes You can put the box in there Oh that s amazing So then you can go ahead and buy a dresser or you know you ll know exactly how much space you need With Marie coming to help us this is the opportunity for me to learn how to organize and to downsize so that I can finally make this place a home Bye I ll get that Bye We ll miss you Til the next time Yeah Oh my gosh That was amazing Can she come back please She blew my mind I know right My goodness Let s get busy with the homework Right We have to If you don t get your homework done you won t be able to sleep Think about it You d better finish Are these my goggles Get out Swim It sounds like you guys are playing Come on now do the right thing in there Oh gosh why did I do this to these shoes too What d you do This Bro Oh no But those are such good shoes The first Jordans No How s it coming Are you done Almost This is my problem You can t Finish You owe it to yourselves to finish Y all don t wanna do this tonight do you Nope I get frustrated from the clutter I would like for home to feel like home for them and I feel like it starts with me I do So I ve ended up with doing their homework for them Being a mom is demanding I feel accountable for downsizing how things are organized so everyone s like Mom where did you put my this Mom where did you put my that And they know I like being able to say It s here because I know that in their mind it s jumbled and I know that the one thing I want is peace of mind I want to give that to them But it bothers me slightly that they come to me wondering where is everything It s overwhelming So I want I want them to get that We look like we re best friends Marie hi Hi Iida hi Nice to see you Good to see you Welcome welcome I couldn t wait to see you today It s raining so hard today I know I wish I could control it Today s theme is miscellaneous items I ll pull it This category of miscellaneous items there s a lot of different sub categories within this big category The trick is to start with something that s easy for you You know I can actually put this here so we can see what we have So bed linens for Kayci Yes But I wasn t quite sure if I was folding them properly As long as you re folding it upright like this you ve got it Folding fitted sheets seem to trouble many people Fitted sheets contain rubber bands inside so you cannot fold the edges together But don t worry take the sides towards the center creating a rectangle Whichever way you choose to fold the sheets when storing in drawers if you store them standing upright they will look neat So I kinda wanna set the family up to win so I need your advice on that cause you leave your family right Do they maintain the way you have the home organized and everything Yes as a family each person has a room that they re responsible for But laundry that s my forte Right I m sure that s accumulating as we speak Yes Oh my goodness yes So I was wondering when I first met you I noticed that a lot of the cleaning and tidying fell to you Do you think through this process that ll change I think they ll be more proactive because they now have some clue of where their things are And instead of me doing it I think now I ll be able to just guide em and not just me doing it You know you re living together so it s important for everyone to maintain their space and their belongings but not only that but to help each other as well Before Marie came I wasn t setting my own self up to win as a mom I was doing too much Instead of being a homemaker I m a make it work maker Do what you gotta do to make it work be strong be tough And that love is just dwindling down because no one person can do it all So Marie s right We all need to work together as a family I like the idea of assigning everyone Yeah It gives them a job that they re responsible for But I m nervous about the organization of it because they sort it and I helped with the organizing so It s perfectly understandable for you to help and create their storage spaces but I think it s important is that every time you remind them where everything is so that they start to learn To make Yes I agree I m going to adopt that and I m sure I won t have a problem They like teamwork so definitely Thanks for sharing Thank you Thank you I want to load this bucket Yes With everything we can Mm hmm Take it out there so we can do it as a family Got it I may get serious Nolan Kayci Calm down Everybody come get one thing and we re done I got us in this hole let me get us out of it I feel like this is my chance to redeem myself and to help the family So I m excited Yay Bathroom s clear How are you guys feeling Did you know all this was in there Yeah I know you guys don t know where to find half this stuff This is the stuff you guys call me about Yeah So now that we can do this I ll know exactly where it is and more importantly you ll know exactly where it is Okay I want to learn where I should put things but at the same time I kind of like my mom having to know where everything is because I don t have to think about it as much That s the procrastinator coming out in me Listen you re gonna have to take care of these things and find a home for them Do you even have all the pieces Yes You have a knitting loom in here Yes Oh wait I knew that Let me talk about our new lifestyle If you opened this and saw this in here why not take this out and go put it in its home Well I didn t know to do that So now Now I do know Let me ask you does this have a home Yes Where In my drawer At the end of this process I want my children my husband and myself I want our family to know how to organize for the sake of having a home and not just a house Douglas I m chilling You can do whatever you want Mm hmm But just know we ve got some homework to do Hey Hey So when I came in I was like What s going on here All this stuff is crazy That s trash This is all trash The box underneath is trash You can take out all of that trash and the only reason I didn t I love you so much is because it was raining Alright Okay thank you I ll talk to you later Duties in the house We all do cleaning We all try to manage um Ahem What Dad doesn t clean Dad doesn t do the bathroom Dad doesn t do the kitchen Not as much as you Okay hold on That was Yeah we do it way more I ll say this you guys do do those areas more than me But I do cleaning when you guys are asleep picking up your backpacks picking up your socks picking up your shoes sweeping I like to think of that as straightening up Yeah I hear you Ah You flinched You guys working nicely in there Yeah Let s get to work I have get the mail take out the trash Write it down Recycling You get the mail Yes I do get the mail I m laughing at you two These These just Lie lie lie lie lie It s a lie Oh my I m so excited about you helping Yeah You can put these back No I was uh putting em out for drying I m not gonna dry the clean dishes with those towels cause those are not clean Got it I feel guilty about Katrina having the majority of the housework That s one of the reasons why I ve been trying to be more active you know with the cleaning and the chores and the duties I can organize certain things that I feel confident in but certain things I just don t feel confident in just yet I left you this space You can keep sitting em right there I didn t wanna do that You can sit that right there What did you wanna do Dad Yeah it doesn t even matter How do you want me to grab em and dry em No no no that s fine I m thankful to get help from my family Even though they re still I think a long way to go I feel like my family is off to a good start Hi hello It s Marie Hi Hi Marie and Marie Hi It s been too long Too long We ve missed you We re gonna work together on the In the kitchen Together I m okay Yes Douglas I d love for you to work on sentimental items the last category I know that all the steps that you ve gone through was very very difficult All throughout you ve sharpened your decision making skills so you should be confident in your ability to go through your sentimental items Alright I ll start pulling the things out to start the process Thank you Alright Good luck Right Good luck I need it Good luck to you Wish me luck Right I m nervous Good luck She s scared So the items that are sentimental we re going to try to categorize those for each individual So if you come across something that you know that s Mom s put it in Mom s sentimental pile Alright Yeah No Thank you Something smells good American trash bags are amazing It smells so good American garbage bags smell nice This cabinet is ridiculous It s hard to reach Going forward let s try to keep things that we don t use as frequently in hard to reach places like that When using kitchen cabinets in the area that is easily accessible store items that are used often such as plates glasses and mugs On the top shelf store items that are used less often such as seasonal plates and plates for guests Paper plates and straws are also items that are used less often These types of items can become easily accessible if stored in a box Maybe a little bit more safe Thank you This one Yeah Nolan just decided to keep it It was a sippy cup his godmother bought for him and it s engraved Yeah And we asked him Will you drink out of it He s like Yes yes And we re like We can put it with your trophies or in the kitchen He said Put it in the kitchen Put it in the kitchen Okay so let s make this a decoration for the kitchen We ll decide a nice place for it later Okay I love the way she doesn t make any of the family members feel bad about what they wanna keep or what they don t I mean I m learning That s very important when you re tidying to respect each other Having a family of my own and being a mother and I think that the things in our house and all the family members in a home kind of function the same way We each play a role and we only have a limited amount of space and we all need each other That s true It s so true I understand Thank you Thank you This process that Marie s helping us with is uncovering layers not justto material things but like the layers between our dynamic with our family Mom she s been the one that has been trying to keep us all together and keep us organized and so now that we have this tidying method I feel like we really need to keep it up Mm hmm You know Not just for her but for ourselves you know Before I had the wrong mentality to not want to engage and help and even not see the value of learning something like this But now I realize the responsibility should not be on Mom It should be on the family the members of that house I m gonna be the laundry champion You gonna be able to sort it too I ll assist you with sorting so I can learn Mm hmm Gonna be a laundry champion Alright Stay on top of it I didn t realize the pressure of having to do everything until I actually did it So now I do want to help with that a lot more I am working on organizing more of my studio equipment that was under the printer area So all of your items pretty much fit in your closet now Yeah Lot of hard work you re doing a great job Thank you Nolan and Kayci they re doing a terrific job I m literally looking at their shelves and how they re organizing I can t believe they did it without me You just feel so proud Our life is finally coming together That s how That s how I feel The kids are doing great You re doing great I m trying to keep the energy high We re gonna get through this Awesome I m definitely getting instant gratification For one I have the entire Fantastic Four doing it with me This is looking pretty good guys I came around to check on everybody and I saw the most amazing thing What d you see Mom Everybody had everything folded They had it lined up standing Especially me Nice and neat on its own socks underwear shorts anything that was difficult Especially me They had it all Dad I had it He had it all in a file system I could cry Like my family is becoming a family My family is growing my kids are doing their own thing My kids know how to take care of their resources New day new joy Whoo hoo Marie brought a whole bunch of joy upon our home I think my mom is way less stressed out I can see it in her face I can see it in her movement She lifted the weight off my mom s shoulders A lot of weight Because now me and my sister can do things by ourselves without asking her Where you gonna put those to dry Uh I ll lay a towel out or I ll just dry em You know where to get the towels from I do know where to get the towels from You know where to put the towels back I know where to put the towels back Okay just checking I trust you I trust you I trust you This method has helped us to grow up I know for sure me I m saying us but I m saying me I m growing up here You

think about to when you first arrived and not only was the home all over the place our lives were all over the place Yeah See the biggest thing for us was that we didn t have the ability to know how

home I feel joy and I feel peace being here Thank you so much Amazing job thank you Thank you Thank you Mm hmm I feel proud Yeah I thought that moving here and living in this space was something I

make room going forward I can t just only live in the past Yeah So yes I think you will find that this opportunity for us to work together is really a time for you to reflect upon your life and start tidying and organizing your life I want to keep lots of memories still Yeah yeah But I would like to value how you feel about your past and your memories Of course Thank you thank you Well I m thanking you for sitting down and not running out the front door going Ah This is too much So this is where we begin where we start our tidying process I m ready I have really kind of stated to everybody this year for me is my year to tidy up my whole life So I ve been through an awful lot and I m I ve learned a lot I m amazed how strong I have been through it all and I I feel like I ve got the energy and the desire to really prepare for what s to come next whatever that might be I feel so fortunate to be able to go on this journey with you Thank you That makes me That makes me very happy After you finish tidying do you have an image of what kind of life you would like to lead Yeah I I would like to travel again that s really one of the things on my list is to travel cause I I have relatives in fun places around the world Also I would like to have a spare room devoted as a craft room or you know a place for me just to have all my supplies and in one room in one spot organized neatly So those images are very very important but the most important step is to have an image of your ideal lifestyle that you want to lead once you ve finished tidying Clearer the image the better Okay Before we start tidying I would like to greet your house Okay How do you do that Er don t worry about me This is just for her Oh it s it s her Yeah yeah Okay I find the best place to Okay Ah this is okay Thank you so much I will tell you the feeling in this house is spectacular So what I d like for you to remember as you go through this process is that you re not alone the house itself and all your belongings are there to support you and are with you Yes they are Let s start tidying All of your clothes and put them in a pile on your bed Take out all of your clothes and make a mountain on your bed Okay This is hard to do Yeah Is this yours or That s Rick s Okay Just yours this time Yeah This end we leave for now Yeah And this I always recommend that clients wait to tidy belongings of a loved one until the end The reason is because tidying those items is very difficult So there is a high chance that it will stall the tidying process Gonna make a mountain Thank you It looks different when you see it thrown on your bed like that I know Oh this is mortifying Yeah Oh my God It s gonna be up to the ceiling I have a feeling Oh Wait you need to Yeah That was a workout look at this Yes Look at it it s just So this is the start Hold each item one by one and choose item that spark a joy for you Um I just Oh my God That s all I keep saying So you ll be able to be more attuned to what sparks joy for you if you start with something that you obviously like and you wear all the time you re just sure it sparks joy for you My two robes my three robes These couple of things I wear a lot This has sparked joy for you Yeah those are my cozies Okay This one I I have had this since I was nursing babies My youngest is almost But it s okay I can say goodbye If you are letting go of an item that you have a lot of memories of that s when you want to say thank you from your heart I know thank you thank you Lots of I can t believe how long this lasted so many years But Yes this is this chapter is behind me Yeah So thank you I m just um feeling a little bit like Wow this is gonna take me a long time I would love to be doing it with Rick I mean there s really nobody else I could choose to do this with He was so capable of so many things and now it s kind of like smacking me in the face with Okay he s not here What are you gonna do now How do you feel now It was more than I thought it was gonna be First of all the amount of stuff Yeah But it was easier than I thought in the sense I can do without that you know I ve I ve been through some serious battles lately so making decisions about clothes is very um Well quite a bit easier than I thought Yeah I was surprised how smoothly you made the selection so I think it s going very well Thank you so much Can I give you a hug Yeah Thank you thank you so much My life has transformed just completely um in the last year You know when you choose a person for years you know you want to be with that person and it s a big void in the house and in my life and I honestly have never lived alone Oh my God I do hope that this will allow me to have um some thoughts about what can I do what do I want to do the things that I haven t actually allowed myself to think I want to be able to fantasize about how do I wanna decorate the bedroom for example Or how would I redo this and I have a hard time making decisions But um it s all on me now I don t have to run it by anybody And that s an experience I guess I have never had before where it s just solely me making my decisions Hi Good morning Good morning Nice to see you Hello Hello Welcome back Yeah Come on in Hi lida Good to see you again Thank you Welcome welcome Yeah Has it been a week You want to come see what I ve been up to Yeah This is what I m getting rid of Look at all those bags Those are all gonna go yeah And all these purses Yeah I don t even know where some of these purses are from I don t remember them they ve been up there so long in my closet What I m wondering is what do I do now This is all I am keeping from my purses Do I need to get a container to put them into maybe If you have a container A basket or basket that would be great Many people feel that there isn t enough space to store bags So I suggest the Bag in Bag Method Okay so I just have to basically get started on getting Rick s items out of the drawers so that I have more room to finish putting my things away I suppose So what s important for you to do right now at this stage is to really just focus on yourself You can set aside Rick s clothes for now we ll come back to that Okay We ll take the steps to do that I don t want to jump ahead of the process I I m learning so okay I do associate things with memories for sure It s hard to stay on focus cause I ve got Rick s items still to be dealt with I don t want to constantly be thinking about that every time I get dressed in the morning I m definitely anxious but I have to trust Marie s process Okay The next on your step is books Okay With books we follow the exact same process as clothes We will be gathering all the books in the house and going through them one by one Ooh I will literally just stand up here and climb it Okay This is all built in Ah built in Okay Yeah I think these are um Rick s cowboy books When we used to go on vacation he d always read an easy cowboy book So do you like to travel Yeah I used to work for the airlines so we did a fair amount of traveling Yeah yeah That s a keeper How do you feel looking at all these All the books I feel like I m in somebody else s library cause I don t know what a lot of this stuff is So So before I start Gotta wake em up Exactly Wake up the piles Before I start tidying books I like to wake them up a little bit It s a little easier to sort through Um okay How do I decide what I want to keep It s perfectly natural to feel anxious Just start with something easy you obviously don t want Okay But I m I m wrestling with not feeling finished up there I feel like I m jumping into something else and I m not done I was sort of prepared to pull all of Rick s things out Yeah yeah I I mean it s not gonna be the easiest thing but I m tough and I m I m not gonna be tough now But I really think I was mentally preparing for that So I I sort of feel like I wanna kind of finish before I jump into the next thing I understand Let s shift the rules for you Margie That That That I think that would make me feel comfortable I m so happy that I was able to understand you a little bit better You know I am here to help you so whenever you need help or you re stuck call on me and I ll come right over Thank you Normally when we work on sentimental items too quickly we become stuck because our ability to determine what sparks joy has not been sufficiently honed yet But this was a very special case so I allowed Margie to work on some sentimental items first I offered to help Margie tidy Rick s clothing with her but she expressed her wishes to tidy his clothes alone so I trusted her to do that on her own Okay Thank you again Thank you Thank you Goodbye see you soon Enjoy the beautiful day Okay bye This is kinda hard You know I looked at those shirts and I thought of all the hopes and dreams he had while he you know was in his Hawaiian shirt phase and then it went into the cowboy phase And you know it s just kind of a real jolt to see all this life you know that we ve lived and the dreams that he had and you know they are now in a pile on the floor and my closet is empty And that that was a very big jolt for me today It was It was a difficult process for me I More so than I expected And seemingly kind of final I ve been so good throughout this and I ve been looking at it so long and just wanting it to go away but I guess it s just that final final chunk of you know what s so visibly him Evidently there s lots of him in the house and I ve got all his papers and belongings otherwise but you know the clothes are a very physical thing His His presence was so big his clothes are so big his shoes are so big and it s just very noticeable he s not there Okay Ah Hi Morning Hi Hi I m Margie I have a big donation for you Margie Thank you We love it It s amazing what I m getting rid of Okay Clothing Oh you ve got a lot of things I do do you have room Perfect yes Absolutely I did it That truck was packed and um a lot of life a lot of memories and You know and my head is full of years of memories So I have that no one can take that It s gonna feel good when I drive off I m just a lot a lot a lot Getting to this point was a lot of work it was a lot of memories it was a lot of emotions and I want to only remember the good Hi hi hi How was your weekend Hey Good I want to see the closet now Oh You haven t seen it Okay No Whoa that s creepy Isn t it Hello Aww That s sad I know I know it s it s really impactful when you see Yeah all his stuff out of here I I kept one long flanneland his jacket and I still have some of his boots I finally am feeling really different I feel proud of myself you know I I I always told Rick You re making me lazy because he does things so well and does so much that I don t have to Not that I couldn t but I never had to And now I enjoy that I know I can if I need to Hi hello Hello Welcome back girls Hi Oh my God You look so beautiful Thank you thank you It s like you know the weather change Yeah summer Yeah So how s everything Good Well come on in The next thing I am thinking about having you tackle is the room that used to be your kid s room Okay so this room It seems like it s a little more tidy than the last time I was in here Did you go through them all Well I I have been taking things and adding things and Yeah I Maybe I was trying to group things too maybe a little bit Um just dealing with upstairs was very emotional for me more difficult than I was expecting to deal with Rick s stuff Regarding the tidying process I understand that you ve overcome a very major step I m very proud of Margie for her accomplishments I felt very deeply what a significant presence Rick was in Margie s life I also felt that she s now ready to continue tidying so I would like to continue the lesson with her Okay so we re gonna start looking at miscellaneous items in this room One by one Okay The things that you want to keep like the scrapbooks the craft equipment all those you want to keep keep them confidently Okay Alright This is a treasure hunt in here girls Do you want these No no I don t know what they are You guys have first dibs on any of my fabulous junk Well for instead of Ah That s where I get myself in trouble I m ready to run away from home This is the worst I ve experienced so far I m a closet stasher I m fessing up The secret is out and I m owning it and I don t want to feel like this anymore Oh God How do I know Yes you will Or do I get rid of it now and if I need it again I go spend cents and buy a new one Well I don t know you guys Help me out help me out I don t know So if you feel overwhelmed just take a moment to breath in and out I know the decision making is very mental and it makes you weary Okay So if you re unsure let s keep it for now It was a good feeling to know that Rick s clothes is a closed book now and I can move forward with this process but um I realized soon enough that I have so much to do and to have it all on me is just Aah I felt like Wow It s overwhelming There s so much to deal with and so many decisions and I don t know how I ll get it done I really don t I gotta figure out a lot of stuff Uh and there s so so many So I think going forward Margie your challenge will be just tackling each item one by one calmly and you are an expert already at identifying what sparks joy for you and what doesn t You ve already done that so many times You ve come so far and there s so much storage space in this house so don t try to focus on what you need to eliminate You know focus on what you wanna keep and how you want to store them That should be your focus Okay I have a lot of work to do but I ve gotta try things on my own that I ve never done before I guess that s what this is all about You know preparing myself for my next chapter It stresses me that there s just so much But I am sucking it up I m gonna be tough and get it done Thanks for all your help Thank you Okay you guys I ll see you soon Safe travels Thank you Okay empty shelves And I still have some more spices to go in addition to all of this that I already pulled out A lot of the stuff that we had here was for Rick s kind of cooking so I am going to figure out what sparks joy in my life at this moment going forward and what kind of cooking am I gonna be doing Woo Okay this is a lot of stuff I ve gotta go get a basket Who knows what s in my chemical closet This is a couple of years old I m surprisingly feeling perky today cause I ve had a grueling week I have been at it cleaning and sorting and making decisions Um and maybe it s just because I see such progress finally Oh here s some towels I haven t seen in a decade Yeah I m getting the hang of it that s true Am I doing up top or down below Yes please Which one All all of it I m enjoying just not answering to anybody and not having to consult That s kind of exciting I m looking at my house with fresh eyes So I have a lot of photographs I need some help Absolutely I d be delighted to give you a lesson on photographs today Okay Okay Yes So I have so many photographs of th of July Hmm I have to look carefully like how old were my kids you know to try to find out the year These are all th of July So there are two ways to do this and you can use both ways You can of course categorize by year but you can also categorize by events I did the same thing when I was sorting though my photos Okay that s probably a lot easier And then I have some you know other miscellaneous things that I ve been saving Of course Are these sentimental items as well Yeah yeah Sentimental miscellaneous items Yeah so I you know at least I have em in a box but You Margie you have so many amazing cute craft goods You can make your own box that way Oh yeah you know what I could I could Or make the labels to go on them you re right Absolutely Store sentimental items in a way that sparks joy For example store them in a box that sparks joy So separate them into the s the s the aughts It s very very good mix of everything here Yeah Look at my hair s Maybe s Oh s s You know it s s Oh God I think all the baby steps I have taken has prepared me for this this section It got through to me as in some way I learned how easy it was to discard things recycle things whatever it might be but I haven t had as difficult a time parting with things as I would have thought I can feel that the energy is brighter and that you are enjoying your life more And congratulations on successfully completing all the categories Thank you to my mentor and mentor extraordinaire assistant In these last few weeks I think I m getting a better sense that I am definitely stronger than I would ever have admitted to being So I I you know that s why looking forward to the future what is out there for me I I don t know I know I m capable of so many things and things that I have never considered So you know that makes it fun to get up each day and see what s gonna unfold There s a lot of stuff out here Ah This looks really antique Oh There s containers over there too Hi Hi Hi It s so nice to meet you Hello This is my baby Oh This is Lucy Well come on in We have a beautiful day here today Yeah it is beautiful out Where do you want to start I ll be happy to show you Start with that room right there Okay lead the way Can I take a peek at the linen closet Yes linen closet Tah dah Eh It looks so neat now All by myself The fact that you ve mastered how to store everything to this level means you can work with any space going forward I m realizing that through this journey Okay so on to the next room Okay Surprise I am so surprised My gosh I m floored I ve been working so hard This is a completely different room It is Oh my goodness I have been working so hard and I wanted to surprise you I can t believe there s I can t believe you can touch the carpet I never thought I d be able to do this and see this whole view of the carpet And that s my new hashtag I wrote it KonMargie Similar but different I think this will turn into a lovely room for your hobbies and your passions Well I did it This room is complete I know I just haven t slept in two weeks This process has been very therapeutic I think In many ways It s sort of a rebirth for me This lovely old house that there s been so many wonderful memories shared here and so many more to make And to see how it s gonna shift um is anybody s guess at this point It is a little harder Actually it was a lot harder than I thought it would be for myself You re saying goodbye to a life and all his attire was so representative of our life together for so many years It was hard But I I have to think that he would be proud I I could just visualize him in the family room in his spot just sitting there with me spinning circles around him cause that was often the way life was I hope he s amused and smiling down and giving me the thumbs up saying You re doing the right thing Unfortunately Rick isn t here to continue on with the plans that we had made and the dreams that we had for our golden years but I don t feel despair I feel you know very happy for the life we lived and going forward I m anxious and excited for what lies ahead So how do you feel Lucy seeing how your mother progressed through this and made such huge strides I am proud of her It s gonna be great for her to have a You can even feel the air and the energy in the rooms has changed Tidying Margie s home was an unforgettable journey for me as well I was so moved by KonMargie s endeavors Thank you again We ll see you soon Okay bye Bye Nice to meet you I am so happy that I was able to assist Margie spark joy in the next chapter of her life I was moved deeply by this experience It almost made me cry I wanna be stronger Let out my roar And tell the world that I m wiser Let go my fears You ll hear me scream Like oh oh I d walk through the fire fire You know unbreakable I m gonna get stronger Never gonna stop me 
 Ah She looks excited I m so excited because I love mess It s a never ending battle to fight the clutter Oh I want things to be more simple I don t know how to fix it With the baby coming it s gonna be more chaos Oh my God We have too much stuff Hello I m Marie Kondo My mission is to spark joy in the world through cleaning Ching Best selling author and world renowned tidying expert Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring the world to choose joy with the KonMari Method The KonMari Method is unique because I organize by category rather than by location In the KonMari Method we tidy five categories in a specific order First is clothing I can t reach Next is books Giving them a little shake and wake them up Then paper I can t do the papers The largest category is komono Komono is kitchen bathroom and garage Everything miscellaneous Finally sentimental items It s kinda hard to let it go cause I really like this one This is kinda hard I don t want to just you know dump it But I want to be thoughtful about it From the moment she set foot in our house she had this presence to her She wants to see this place turned around Marie brought a whole bunch of joy upon our home This is amazing You re so cute I love you You re so cute I love you too These are like happy happy tears Thank you for what you ve brought to our home really You didn t see me wash my hands before but I want you to know I washed my hands before Okay Good Okay In case you were worried about that Hi my name s Frank and I have lived in this happy home for a little over two years now My name is Matt and I have lived here a little over three years Oh so it s not a happy home for you Okay Alright Cool Thanks I can never find the spice that I want ever Do you have any idea what artichokes look like when they re done They re just tender I don t know what they look like We are a classic love story We opened an app and swiped right Mm hmm And that s uh how we met And Matt moved fast It was like Let s go on a date and I m like Okay sure We went to this bar near my house and Matt goes to the bathroom he comes back and I m like Oh do you want a second drink He just grabbed my face and kisses me and I was like Okay okay So we go back to my place on Friday night Matt does not leave until Monday morning We keep canceling everything we have so we can hang out with each other So at the end of this hour date we have said I love you and said that we want to be in a relationship and stay together forever For those keeping score at home this was after three dates and a week and a half of dating We re still here three years later so So I talked to my mom Mm hmm But what do we have to do before they get here Um I don t know just make the place look presentable would be nice That s a good start My parents have not visited me in California since I moved here actually five years ago I love my family but I m also really nervous for them to come visit because if you were to walk through our home you d think that college students live here We very rarely make the bed Between us we accumulate a lot of stuff I feel like both of us have things from our college days that are in our closets Yours I m more worried about Yours has melted cough drops on the floor Oh That one came up That s good Busted Busted I m proud of our place but it definitely can use that extra oomph It s just not quite there And I yeah And I want it to be before your parents get here Our home is a reflection of our relationship So if our home isn t in harmony I feel like they might worry that this might be just temporary So Yeah I could see that It d be nice if it looked nice for them for sure My parents they ve met Matt they love him but just to see that like the life we ve created together is something to be like admired I think if they take our home seriously they ll be taking our relationship seriously and that s what we want to make sure they know this is We re gonna be here for a while and we re gonna be together forever Tidying not only changes your home or life but it also allows you to create a space that suits your ideal self Frank and Matt are a young couple wanting to live a more mature lifestyle I am so happy to be able to support them during their transition into adulthood Hello Hi Nice to meet you Very nice to meet you Hi I m lida Miss Marie s interpreter Sure nice to meet you Hi nice to meet you I m Frank this is Matt Ah Hello Hi It s very clean in here Thank you Thank you We wanted it to look clean for you So I d love to get a little bit of a tour of your space Of course That d be great So this is our living room We uh watch a lot of TV We have all our board games here Yeah and some pictures postcards and stuff Some books and we also have all our DVDs are here on those shelves with some books Every space I ve ever had my parents referred to as a college dorm And so I don t know that I ve given them every reason to like respect me as an adult That s why I really want the place to look like someplace they can trust me as an adult to live in And I want them to see like we ve got a handle on it Mm hmm We re good you raised us right Well me they didn t raise you But yeah I write at the desk a lot I m a writer too so I usually will be just working here This is my sort of station here What kind of writer are you I m a TV comedy writer Do you guys work together You re As a pair Yeah No No I don t know if we want to put that tension on our relationship Still very neat here Oh no It ll get worse It ll get worse Okay Well before you decide that um so we only have one closet in our bedroom so my closet s right here Yeah Take a look Please go right ahead Ah Yeah Feel free There isn t Seems to be a lot of things stuffed deep in there There s a world in there yeah Wow it s so deep Yeah I see there s a place to hang clothes all the way in the back Yep that there is Oh wow Okay Oh wow Look how deep it goes Yeah Oh my goodness In terms of storage space this is very nice So most of your clothes Frank are in here In the room there is still a dresser where I have like a lot of other stuff Okay the rest of the the Sure yeah So next we have the kitchen in here Our pantry is open so you can kind of see the chaos This is where we keep our dishes I see a little bit of clutter now Okay Okay I think the kitchen might be our most disorganized area For sure Yeah We d accumulated stuff over the years because we had roommates come and go and some people just left their stuff I hate the kitchen I get out of the kitchen as fast as possible And he loves food so that s actually So that s that s been hard Somebody who loves food to just grab it and go He just runs into the kitchen and grabs the snack and runs out Yeah you d think there were an egg timer and the floor would collapse in a certain amount of time Yeah Yeah I m already getting a vision of how better its going to be So I m getting very excited And then straight ahead is the bedroom These are Frank s drawers here They re all very stuffed full Uh pants And also there used to be lots of documents in here that I just got rid It was worse if you can believe it Ah What about this Closet It s pretty bad Closet So how is this separated Well this is just mine I m the baby of my family so I think I ve always been given a little bit of slack when it comes to like chores Definitely kept a messy room I rarely made my bed which might be part of the reason why I am so cluttered right now I didn t really learn those good habits But I ve been the baby long enough and I kind of need to move onto that next stage Although those socks are mine that you re seeing right in front of you Ah So Frank do you always reach in here and get your socks This is new I used to have them in here but It was an attempt to de clutter this but it uh yeah Growing up whenever my mom asked me to clean I would just shove a bunch of paper in my desk and be like It s clean And that s sort of what we ve done with our closets They re overflowing There is some closets we haven t looked at for a long time I m organized in some aspects of my life like professionally My email inbox is organized I m great And I just like get frustrated with myself that I haven t translated that into into my home life It feels like I give it all at work and I come home and I m like First thing I wanted to ask was why the two of you felt that you wanted to go on this tidying journey with me I think that we both have felt that it s a little bit dorm like it s a little bit adolescent And I think in particular is you saw we re good at hiding things that aren t organized so to the outside world people walk in and say What s wrong with it But like we know what we aren t liking Has your friends or family often visit here My parents have come around a couple of times but your parents haven t visited at all They are coming next month so it s especially important to me to like make the home someplace that they feel uh welcome as guests and not just as parents who have to like reorganize or clean or anything I want them to just to be here have a nice experience and then go back to where they came from I don t feel actively judged by my parents but that being said I do feel like I have thrown them a few curve balls I didn t go to medical school I am in a gay relationship and um I don t know why I m getting worked up about this They re very loving people but uh you know I don t know that I ve always uh It s probably just in me again feeling like I haven t always made them proud I m sure every kid goes through that being like Oh have I like justified my parents having me and all the expenses But yeah I want them to see this home and feel really like We did everything we could for this kid and he s really taken on everything we taught him and we love him It d mean a lot for them to really be come in here and see all that that I m feeling about this place I And that s a lot of a meaning to attribute to a home but it has that for me Before we start I want to first introduce myself to the home If that s okay This is a ritual that I do before we begin I think this will do So while I introduce myself I would love for you to picture your vision for your home Okay Very good Very good Thank you so much How did you feel communicating with the home I think more so than anything when I was concentrating there was like a feeling I had of like just joy of like people walking through me being happy with how it was us being happy It s like I want to get that feeling It s very important to have a vision and to communicate the vision to your home It allows the rest of the process to go much more smoothly So ready Yeah As ready as we re gonna be Just around here Just keep it together as much as possible Yeah Almost done Okay That s it Very good Well done What do you think looking at all the clothes that you own There s so many I don t wear or need Definitely looks like a lot more when I see it piled in one place So what we ll be doing is you ll be going through all of your clothes one by one and selecting only the clothes that spark joy for you What does spark joy mean for you Oh for me spark joy is all about how my body reacts So when you hold an item in your hands that sparks joy for you this is how your body should react Ching Do you understand Yeah Yeah The cute sound that she made that I m not gonna translate Is there anything that you see in here that clearly sparks joy for you Yes definitely Let s try touching that That is really cute You also should envision as you go through the selection process Like what do you see yourself wearing that will make you feel more mature and grown up So before I visit next time please finish complete all of your clothes This feels like kinda like the last step to get us to being adults And I think we just need that last push Like that push out of the nest that the mama bird does Hopefully Marie can be our mama bird I ve actually watched Planet Earth that doesn t actually happen No bird pushes their children out the nest You re ruining my metaphor I am but but the point stands uh yeah We need a last bit of energy and we re gonna get it here Uh huh Thank you so much guys Thank you Bye See you soon Bye See you soon Do I like this Eh Thank you See I feel like I have more socks even in my yes collection than you I didn t throw out that many though in all honestly I just guess I don t have as many I m having trouble connecting to the idea of items of clothing sparking joy See so far this is everything I m keeping here I ve felt joy from all of it I definitely was an over achiever at school Gotten As and I ve always grasped concepts really quickly Didn t have to study like a super ton So when I m not getting the concept right away it s kind of like a disconnect of like Like I m usually good at this what am I what am I doing wrong I have a few items that really like speak to me but then I have a lot that don t speak negatively but don t speak positively I feel like are in in the in between My policy for that is sort of like if the answer isn t yes it s no I know That s what it should be What I ve noticed is the stuff that sparks joy like I honestly have that like Oh reaction that Marie was talking about I do have it with some of my clothes but not a lot and that s why I m not filtering as well as you probably I m not really listening to myself I m not always emotionally available I m not the most emotional person Ever since I ve been little I ve been shy and like I ve had a few close friends that I m really close with but then everyone else not so much Sometimes I can seem cold and a little bit distant to people so kind of just opening up as the process goes along would be a good first stepping stone to that I think I need to re focus I think I ve gotten a little too A little bogged down and have become a little precious Yeah I feel like if you re not sure you keep it Yeah That s fair When I get to the ties I might ask you to weigh in because I feel like you have a good sense of color and I don t want to throw away something where I m just inaccurately assessing what I can pair it with Neckties are important accessories for men So let s store them with respect Store neckties in boxes to keep them organized Hi Hi Hi Nice to see you again Nice to see you again Nice to see you Good to see you Hi Nice to see you Hi Good to see you Is that what I think it is What you re letting go Yes That is a great amount Very well done And let s tackle the books and paper categories next Yeah Yes So let s take out every single book from the house and collect it in one spot Is that yours No it s mine So the process is the same with clothes Take every single book into your hands and see if it sparks joy for you How do you fold the books though I don t see how that works Books you don t fold You read them But with books you also want to ask this question to yourself By having these books will it be beneficial to your life going forward Books are the reflection of our thoughts and values So by tidying books it will show you what kind of information is important to you at this moment Good over there yeah Which one is this Spark joy or no Definitely yes Okay Thank you Thank you Thank you Is this difficult for you going through the books Uh Yeah I assume you always love to read Uh yeah ever since I was a kid Like when the Scholastic Book Fair would come to our school that was like the biggest day of the year What s your number one book that you will never let go Is there such a book I think To Kill A Mockingbird really sparked with me and connected back in high school when I first read it Will you try touching that for me Mm hmm Yeah definitely like I can remember reading it in high school for the first time Um yeah it s a def It s like a for sure like just immediate Books like that are very useful for you because that s the spark of joy that you should be feeling Mm hmm To Kill A Mockingbird really inspired me a lot I still read it about once every two years Um And uh I just really connected to the characters and it really inspired me to want to be a writer myself Um so when I hold this I kind of feel this warm sensation and it slowly dawned on me just like Oh this is what you re supposed to be feeling when you have that spark of joy The ones that I didn t feel connection to it was immediately clear that I was ready to let those ones go I think that you really honed your sensitivity to joy through going through these books Yes I definitely feel that way I think with books I feel more of a connection than I do with clothes where I m just trying to like look decent and I don t put that much energy into it Where books I ve spent the time with them so I m more connected to them The moment you realize what it means to spark joy comes to people at different times As you continue to tidy your sensitivity to joy will be honed So there will be an aha moment when you realize what it means for something to spark joy So even though you decided to keep items now you may feel that you want to revisit those items again later on in the tidying process I m done so All done Oh my goodness You can move on to the next category actually So can you make a pile of paper on the dining room table You bet I can Thank you And done Oh Well done Thank you And now you can see Frank s paper mess that he s just starting on Oh and he s still going I heard that Frank does not let go of any papers He still has notes from like high school and he puts a lot of emotion and memories in those notes I m aware of my problem I guess because I see them stored all over the house So I knew the amount was too high but in order to veil that from myself I increased the number of locations I get very sentimental about cards Yeah well this one I m keeping for sure So this is like sort of history into why I started writing There was a bunch of like Power Rangers fan fiction Ah Scrap in here How old were you when you wrote those So this goes back from when I was a teenager to like this was just a couple years ago I have a great appreciation for my childhood I grew up very happy in my house and as a result I ve kept a lot of like you know little drawings I had even from like age eight or something and I ve kept those just for like inspiration and comfort and warmth and I m worried that like I ll want to hang on to everything I feel like for me this actually might be the hardest Discovering what s difficult for you is just the whole point of this process too which is understanding what sparks joy It s the things that are the most meaningful to you that are the hardest He loves books and I love just writing a lot so The trick to keeping paper documents in order is to have a designated spot in the house Papers you decide to keep can be divided into three categories The first category is pending documents Pending documents are papers that are waiting for you to take action upon such as letters and bills The second category is important documents Important documents are papers that you need to keep permanently such as contracts and insurance forms The last category is miscellaneous documents Miscellaneous documents are papers that you refer to often such as recipe cutouts from magazines or papers from a seminar you attended that you frequently go back to read Oh boy I wrote some angsty songs in college But like on a serious note I think I started songwriting when I was like coming to terms with like having gay feelings and I didn t kinda get it yet It got me through some hard times writing songs so huh You re ready to let that go Part of me feels like I should save these I attribute a lot of emotional value to papers like because even today going through them I was like Oh this was the first script I wrote that like did well in a competition This is like when I first had my creative inklings about this concept and so it s hard for me to let things go That s funny Now I wonder if I should keep it I can t do the papers They re all yours I like papers I ve always liked papers I just like I think it s really just about what like the ones that really you feel like are particularly sparking your joy I love Matt and want the best for him but man there is like a total flip from like clothing to papers that I was not anticipating I totally understand his frustration before and it doesn t feel good to be the one at the back of the class You want to feel like you re really taking it on I sorted the mail already so this is your new mail right here Great Thank you Matthew Yep Appreciate this You re welcome Hi Hi Nice to see you Hi Marie Nice to see you again Come on in Oh we have gifts Exciting Yes Yes We have a lot of boxes Oh Perfect Okay So today s category will be miscellaneous items I m a catastrophizer and it means to prepare for the worst case scenario doomsday but like at all times Someone who catastrophizes it s a problem in your home because you think What if I need this one You just sort of keep everything But then it s ultimately useless cause you don t remember where it is when you need it Do we have an earthquake kit at all prepared No No nothing that for an actual emergency Matt I m gonna make a box of stuff that I don t think I need but I want your opinion on it too Okay Do you know what all these cords are for Some of them I can A lot of them I can t A lot of them I m not sure why they were in there in the first place I was thinking we could use one of these drawers for electronics Okay Out of the miscellaneous items electronic gadgets tend to become a mess The goal is to store things in a way where you can see everything one look TIPS ON STORING MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS COMBINE BOXES TO COMPARTMENTALIZE STORE EVERYTHING STANDING UPRIGH ESPECIALLY SMALL ITEMS SUCH AS USB DRIVES AND MEMORY CARDS Thank you What kind of things are you letting go would you say Um just random things that were like boxes for electronics a lot Um From my first visit to Disneyland out here I just don t think I need it Oh I m torn Matt I m too sentimental Never mind I take it back it brings me joy Thank you Look at you Matt It s a lot less You ve made such huge progress Thank you I feel guilty because I see how much work Matt is doing and I feel like I m not helping him Ever since the paper assignment I have this block against letting go of things And that triggers some disappointment in myself and Pfft Hey Hey I m done with the uh Christmas and holiday drawer Love you I love you too Alright I think I m feeling a little anxious cause I feel like we haven t gotten rid of anything yet and it s making me a little Yes feel crowded I guess Frank is usually the more outgoing person the person with more energy so when he um is feeling a little bit less self confident it definitely puts a damper on things Just because his energy feeds into my energy Feel like I m really glad my parents aren t coming for another what like week and a half Mm hmm Because we are not ready at all So just trying to stay positive and help inspire him cause he did that for me during clothes Medium plates do we need To No It feels extreme We don t need to throw out just to throw out Like I m fine having nine No if it sparks your joy It s not the number and No but I m I meant using the number as like a guideline Yeah yeah Matt can be a little quieter sometime so to see him projecting opinions so openly about the home it made me really happy and inspired that I wanted to you know keep up with him and not like especially because he was experiencing a positive moment I didn t want to take away from it by being like you know sad sack so I was like Okay I have to kind of muscle through this I find myself gravitating towards these perfectly honest but how do you feel We don t use small plates all that often so this would be an extreme amount So I m good letting these go Okay Thank you I don t like either of these so I m good with these leaving Thank you Twenty Yeah We have mugs Thirteen for each That seems totally reasonable For two people In some ways I think like having ties to childhood makes you less of an adult so it s incumbent upon me to know like what really is valuable and meaningful and what I m just sort of afraid to not hold onto anymore I think fear isn t a good reason to hold onto things It should be you know something positive like happiness Plastic knives I don t know if people really use knives Knives we have a ton of I think let it go let it go Yeah I don t feel like we ever cook a quantity of food large enough that we d really need this Thank you I m definitely proud of Frank He puts a lot of memories into these things so it wasn t easy for him letting go of stuff But now I feel like we re both finally on the road to adulthood Oh yeah We re gonna make some people very happy today Where are we going We re going to Out of the Closet to donate our clothes And other objects I feel like we re on the homeward stretch Like it feels like we ve conquered so much in the house already like getting through some of the miscellanea today made me feel like Okay we re like coming on the end Knowing I have this home that like is getting to where I want it to get and will eventually is just like giving me an extra boost that I m for which I m very grateful We are off to Goodwill to donate the rest And I think that will be it believe it or not Hello Hi Hi Nice to see you Nice to see you Marie Hi lida nice to see you again Hi Nice to see you guys Hi How was homework A lot but we actually got all the way through it yep Oh my gosh Let s go see it Can t wait Lead the way Okay Here it is Linen closet Linen closet Oh my goodness Look at how neat it looks Mm hmm And it s washcloths and hand towels Oh Beautiful So beautiful Breathtaking This makes it so much easier to see where everything is Before everything was like exploding out of it It feels much easier now I feel really good I like want to invite a lot of people over now so I can like open up the closets be like See how organized we are Look at this I m growing up and moving on and this is the time where I think we re gonna have a home that we re very proud of Wonderful Okay let s go to the kitchen Can t wait to see So we reorganized and sorted all the food and made this our kind of breakfast area with our coffee maker and toaster It looks like a store Oh my gosh I feel like I am the adult that I m presenting to the world I m not hiding my messy true self anymore We are stronger for doing this because you know it challenged both of us in different ways I had to sort of let go of some things to which I was clinging and Matt over time learned to like vocalize his emotions So I think it helped us address things within our self I definitely feel like I ve become more emotionally open and I finally felt that like Wow like I really am feeling that spark of joy I did want to have that feeling and bring it through the rest of my life because you re just a happier person honestly So how do you feel now that you ve reached the end I m very proud of our home and happy with uh the work we ve done and really grateful for you teaching us Yeah I believe your parents will be pretty shocked to see how tidy this home is Shocked is the word It really feels like our lives are changed because you came and helped us so thank you I don t think it would ve been done if you hadn t come in here and

cause this place looks so nice so In large part to you so And you It was a team effort I suppose you re not nervous at all cause they re not your parents I am nervous I want them to like it of course I do Ah Matt I got a tiny fleck of beet on me Oh it s fine That s barely You sure Yeah Don t put water on it cause that s gonna look wet when your parents get here This visit from my parents is a big thing for me because this home is a symbol of my uh my relationship with Matt and my relationship with my parents my relationship with the world So it s vital that they like what they see Okay Hi Hi Frankie Hi How are you Wow Hi It looks really nice This isn t what I was expecting I thought I d show you guys everything just cause we ve been doing a lot of folding and sort of compartmentalizing

Hi I m lida Miss Marie s interpreter Hi lida Miss Marie s interpreter Nice to meet you And Natalia is two and a half years old She s asleep She s taking a nap right now Oh wow My daughter is same two years old Oh really And one years old You have a two and a one year old Yes And you re organized We have no excuse Alright We have no excuse I m Sehnita I m Aaron We re the Mattisons We ve been married years We met at the University of Michigan junior year I think we just End of junior year start of senior year Started dating senior year we basically decided we want a change of venue the weather time to get some better weather We drove out to Los Angeles and set up here What s going on guys We live with our two children We have a seven and a half year old boy Ashton and an almost three year old Natalia We re here and we love it and we planning on being here a long time There s a thought though as our lives we have so much love to give we live in a wonderful home we re part of a wonderful school district We have a lot of opportunity to bring another baby into this house but the clutter it just feels heavy It s just you know and overwhelming We have a major amount of cleaning that we need to undertake before we move forward This yeah this is the room we use the most Like the kitchen the living room Definitely a lot of time spent watching TV or you know playing Okay so I see part of the problem Yeah you re also seeing part of the problem You know we ve been in our house for seven years But it s a never ending battle to fight the clutter We have things and those things end up taking a space in our house and it s They get spread around just multiplies and pretty soon our house is a chaotic mess If we have a space that opens up pretty soon it ll get filled up You fill up space too I do I do It s gotta go somewhere And look there s an open spot How about there Yes I feel like the clutter is just it s like a big block now But added to it is it s so stressful to clean the house It s hard to think about doing anything else cause it always feels like No I gotta go clean So even when I m relaxing I should be cleaning We have a fish on our table We have a fish I don t why But there it is This is Natalia This is Miss Marie and Miss lida Can you say hi Hi Hello No She ll just sit here for a while Not yet not yet Well this is Ashton s room in here Okay This is his nice big closet So these are his Clothes Oh pajamas His pajamas his uh shirts Aaron wandered in here and realized that I have taken over these three drawers They re awaiting your magic What is that So I was born in Pakistan So if we have Pakistani occasions I have my shawls to take When s the last time you wore them You know I feel such a disconnect to my culture to begin with I don t have a big Indian Pakistani community being here in Los Angeles So you know that s a little piece of connection that I would like to hold onto This is our master We have lots of mess This one is Aaron s closet Yeah these are more like my dress shirts I go to work Um Sehnita s clothes And some books This might be my little problem I have a hard time letting go of magazines This whole pile was in our bathroom I d kind of hidden it from downstairs brought it upstairs hidden it up there Do you have any magazines left in the bathroom right now Not in the bathroom I might have piles elsewhere I do think that Sehnita has a tendency to hold onto more things That s why working with Marie would be very helpful I can t do it by myself I can t make her do it Those are mine Close that door Wait okay Let me go to Go ahead and close that door No Those aren t No You can close those Let me try the next one You can t throw those things I understand that I either hold onto things or I m sentimental about things But we re not dying in here like they don t have to like airlift me out of this house cause there s no path out I m workable Oh my goodness Look at this closet It s huge Okay so all of your dresses here I see So half of these dresses I can t wear right now but I don t want to give up on getting to my goal weight so I don t want to let go of these yet These shorts don t fit me but I can t get rid of them Look at these shoes These are another one of those pairs that I can t get rid of I don t think I ve ever seen her wear them These are maternity clothes We were part of our goal of wanting to clear our house is we would like to add a third baby And it feels like if we can t get our house clean you know maybe we shouldn t go down that path I just know that if we have this much junk right now like if we were to have a third it would only get worse from here Welcome Here it is I think some of the things that we need a little help with in the garage are clothes All these clothes you ve kept you never let any of them go Not any of Ashton s clothes not any of Natalia s clothes These are just suitcases And these suitcases have suitcases in them So I think we need help minimizing a little I feel like You know he s saying we should get rid of them I think we need to take more family trips Not all To make use of them Trivial Pursuit Two of two We need them both Whole different experience We actually have three One s inside And we also have kids toys over there So your kids they don t play with those toys No Not right now If we can get this whole garage organized more then they ll be in a place where they can access them easier Once you do your magic I want to clean up my stuff but I feel like I m not getting there So for me what I ve really wrapped my head around in my life is if I m not doing the things that I need to do then you know go seek out experts that can help you make the change that you need This KonMari Method is not a simple method to clean your house Mm hmm You mentioned my magic I m sorry to say that I don t use any magic Only you can do that But at the same time I have seen many of my clients transform their lives because in their heart of hearts they were ready to prepare to change their life I want to she wants to we want to put in the hard work And that s where I think we re just looking for the guidance Thank you so much I m so honored and thankful to hear you say that We re ready to declutter the home because we foresee staying here for you know the next years maybe So there s nothing that is going to force us to go through our stuff except for something like this I m so excited Good morning Hi Good morning Good to see you Good morning Hi Good morning Hi good morning There s Natalia to greet you She had a slight run in with the dog this morning so she s recovering Do you want to go to the other room Yes So today we ll tackle clothes Oh my gosh This mountain of things So from here you re gonna be going through every single piece piece by piece I feel very overwhelmed It does feel overwhelming Let s take a deep breath of air Stretch When you feel stuck while tidying try and change the air Simply opening the windows will be effective but there are other ways as well Create a sound that has a great vibration Light a candle Spray an aromatic room spray Lighting some incense is also an option By creating smoke it ll purify the room Of course you can do these every day and not just when tidying I use these methods to purify my home every day So my advice is go with something that s very easy for you to make a decision on something that you d know right away You know it s like it s hard to understand my feelings because you know there s some things where I m like No this doesn t spark joy in me It fits me and that s And so it s practical so I m glad it fits me But no I m not happy I have to wear you But I do understand because of my height You have no idea what a nightmare it is for me to find clothes that fit me because I m so short in that sense And small But in a sense I will just recommend picking out clothes that fit you right now that you re comfortable with and decide from there This I wear This I wear And it sparks joy for you Yeah Okay Instead of just basing it on whether you wear it or not think about Do I really need this piece Is it necessary for my life My problem with clothing and feeling the joy it s hard because it s that idea that you don t let go of things if it s functional Like you don t wear cocktail dresses all the time but if you have a cocktail party you don t want to buy a new one each time either Yes Aaron you re doing very well You re doing great Very calm Aren t you the best Don t the teachers like you Don t get angry Aaron and I are different I m funny she s not My friends think I m funny Your friends think you re funny Um yes maybe Aaron s like quick to want to you know be like Okay I gotta clear my space and maybe I slow him down to be like Wait a minute I want you to really think like are you getting rid of anything that might be important to you And for me he s going to help me be like Alright come on you don t need to hold onto those things That s just more things we have to clean up Thank you bye bye Thank you so much Bye Bye A lot to do The homework is now go through our clothes sort through the things we That don t spark joy move them out This is what happens when you first start going through the process I do still feel stuck in the Like having Being in the limbo of having clothes that I need to hold onto But when you say Have to hold onto what do you mean have to hold Why do you have to hold onto em Like you can just easily say This sparks joy this doesn t spark joy There s a certain amount of things that I yeah honestly when I take a step back and I look at some of the stuff I have Like okay do I want to hold onto this because You can t let go of that See this is why I can t show you things With Sehnita and I I would love better communication dealing with items in our house because sometimes it feels like she automatically goes and says No we should keep it That s a lot of stuff We re gonna be here til midnight Not me Nope We are going to be here till midnight I was gonna go downstairs and play video games with Ashton Goodbye Folding clothes is so much fun About folding baby clothes here s how to fold baby onesies First fold in half vertically tuck in the sleeves fold it in half and then fold into thirds Like this when it is folded into a square you are finished Next how to fold socks Place one on top of the other and just fold them in half making them very compact How to fold underwear Fold the bottom up Next fold it in half and then in half again That s my blue jeans here This is gonna be my sweaters here I think I m getting close to getting my stuff gone through I feel good um Isn t that great He feels good I am finding it really challenging to go through my clothes because even things I like don t fit well so I m not willing to let go of all those things I just realized I m on camera and I didn t put on makeup Hmm Alright so I m gonna end this video Hey Sehnita Yeah Marie s here Oh okay Hi good morning Good morning Good to see you again Good to see you Morning good to see you Sehnita s just upstairs doing some work These are all the clothes we ll be getting rid of So this is a mixture of Sehnita s and mine That s wonderful Yes And she s in Ashton s room Ooh Good morning hi Hi Marie How are you Good to see you Good morning Good morning how are you I m feverishly trying to go through these uh scarves and you re here at a perfect time cause I was like I don t know if I know how to fold them Oh but you did it just right Nearly there Okay Okay so first I would make sure that the fringe is rolled inside Okay This way you ll protect the fringes and you ll avoid any unwanted wrinkles And then if they re different sizes like I was trying to do this one and it was a little bit bigger so do I try to get it this size So you can just categorize by size if that s the case I m sure you have other bigger scarves as well so just keep those together Well I m I like this method because honestly um it was so hard when I was stacking them to know what color was in there which one to get so I probably didn t use them as much as I wanted to because I couldn t see them This applies to every storage space but when you open the drawer and you can immediately see what s inside it s really useful It is so useful It was a lot of work It was a lot of work to go through all of our clothes um but we re ready for the next challenge We have ten boxes of books four or five boxes of magazines Something that I do is to wake them up first Books that have been stored in boxes for a long time are sleeping They would like some waking up Yes They re all sleepy And once we ve woken them up take each book one by one and ask yourself Is this something that I would like to bring with me into the future Books are a part of my identity I mean I do really value them and I value them being in our house It will be very hard for me to get rid of them Bye Thank you so much It just feels like those are people s works Just to like kinda just dump them in a trash heap It doesn t feel good to me Think you re gonna use this or you have the internet You got the internet Don t you think Can it be in a maybe pile Where s your maybe pile Here I definitely understand Sehnita seeing certain items and struggling with it as far as looking and saying you know Does it bring me joy or does it bring me guilt for getting rid of it Because even if she said it s okay to let it go she ll have second thoughts Let s get rid of em No I m going No I m not gonna get rid We can t get rid of them We re going to give them for the other baby Why are you whispering to me Because I m trying not to yell Because we re definitely on uh different pages about saving books for a potential third I don t want to at this point get rid of everything just to have to go buy them again next year That doesn t make sense to me That doesn t make fiscal sense to me Like with her I d have to make her feel okay that I m not just going to get rid of things that she wants because I know there is still this fear in her mind that every stage she s concerned that I m going to move things out that she s going to regret losing Final check for the books I guess Sehnita s just doing a one last review of the books in here Um I thought they were all boxed I said Hey I m gonna take these to the garage She was like I want one more look So so close I guess this is the final stage Uh oh she s got a pile of books she s holding onto Oh Sehni Marie s here with boxes Hello Hello Can I help It s fine You re fine Hi good to see you again Hello how are you So good to see you The deeper we get into this it s really difficult to do But I will say little by little walking into open spaces has been Like you feel it You feel so much better And you know who s loving it the most Mazzie the cat She is loving the open spaces She s pouncing here and there and I want to feel the joy that cat is feeling So books pretty much done I see Yes We finished up the books It was tough but like magazines she actually got rid of a lot of magazines You might have thought that was a simple task for me to get my magazines out but they were there for a few days weeks Well done Our focus going forward is all the miscellaneous items The garage and also the children s toys So for toys gather them all together at once You will be going through them as parents and deciding how often do they get used but I m sure your kids have a particular attachment to certain toys so this is where you want to engage the kids and work together with them as well Really encourage them to thank each item that they re letting go When tidying kids toys take out all the toys first If you have more than one child create a separate pile for each For example these are brother s these are sister s and here are shared toys Have your children choose the toys that spark joy However all toys may spark joy for them So ask them to rank the toys When it comes to storing toys it is important to divide the space clearly For example this box is for him these boxes are for both and one box is for her When you store shared items you can keep them according to category Here are the toys for physical play And here are stuffed animals These can be stored like this Thank you Bye Bye Bye see you later See you later Okay let s work Toys Toys are everywhere The toys we have so many toys Do you like your toys all piled up Natalia Yep Happy birthday We got this for you I m ready to get rid of a lot of it For Sehnita the toys are tied to emotional sentiment with people who gave us particular toys the toys being attached to memories from when Ashton and Natalia played with them Ashton wanted this case Like wanted when he was like four years old Natalia probably wants it You re killing me I would like to keep the Transformer types I think they re kinda neat Um But they don t really play with them Yeah but I do Hey Natalia why s there a mess on the floor I Cause I wanted to give it away You want to give all that away Yeah So you were going through your toys and making a pile of things you don t want Uh no I want it Can you pick out one toy that you don t really play with anymore Hmm ah Alright and that s how you start And everyone else is setting up for a nice somewhat lazy Sunday but Mom and Dad are gonna get off the couch and get up to work again Not right now But dear The garage is a mini version of our house It has anything and everything in it What about all these like pots Some of those pots are gonna go some are going to have our succulents put into it Are we doing this right now I m just looking at this beauty It is pretty isn t it I was being facetious Sorry I walk into it and I m like I don t know where to start Bikes We can t really get rid of any of them because if we do have the third they re going to want it These two boxes are from the move so we ve been in this house for seven years we haven t unpacked those But if we have the space for it why can t we just keep it Oh Natalia s going to be mad at you about this I don t want to get to the point of throwing my hands up and saying We re just gonna live in a pigsty But Sehnita s having a hard time letting go of a lot of things She needs to commit From zero to five years old it s hard to give give that up What he says is We don t need this And then I stop Well no I do or I do want it This is our garage and the only thing of tools is one little shelf There s no garage stuff in here Wait honestly It s like toys and clothes and Yes so Put it into perspective One thing for tools the rest is everything else You re making me the bad guy for I don t know what I definitely feel like I m being guilted into getting rid of things I don t think that s what it s about So if I go back to Oh no I wanna keep that thing why isn t it a very clear like Okay sure I m not gonna feel bad about that I m sorry So when you try to tell me I don t let go of things I don t like that You have got to stop otherwise we re never gonna get through this I m at a loss The more I think about it the more I just get upset I get that I have a strong personality I thought the whole process is hey you talk you share you share your thoughts your feelings You You lay it all out there Well I feel like laying it all out there only makes it worse Maybe it s just a cultural difference Maybe it s just different styles and methods And if that s the case I can t change someone else either I m looking to change I m open to change I wanted to go through this process And This was my step forward and I m not looking to go backwards So this place is gonna get into shape no matter what And that s just how it is What s a matter Huh This has been a pretty challenging and nerve racking process for us to go through together But now I realize Aaron and I do not need a lot of things to be happy and I think that s part of what has drawn us to each other And to be able to come together in this process and re establish that idea you know us in our family like we don t need a lot of things and that s been interesting because of all of the things that we were surrounded by I think we were forgetting that You want tea Yes What time d you go to bed last night Four four thirty So what were you doing Like why am I holding onto a seven dollar shirt I got really cheap that doesn t really fit It s kind of putting it in perspective I don t need to hold onto this Every single one of us should be examining the things we have and deciding if we need it or not I really just had this feeling like I m ready to let go and to take control of the things that are in my house Are these garbage Those shoes Yes I guess I ll just get rid of em You served me well shoes These things that are just taking up space in your own house you gotta give it up Does it bring you joy Now if it s nostalgia the story Not really Okay well then I mean thank you It feels good to sort of move this out of the Yeah out of the garage sort of move it out of our house and then to a better home It is exhausting I really do feel extremely exhausted and we re not even at a halfway point yet Very overwhelmed So it s Friday A couple days since we had the mass chaos of dumping out a lot of things Yeah This I think we need to get a vase from outside I don t That can those It can go Then I ll throw this stuff out Great I ll be back You got a little excited about that She s doing a lot she s giving away a lot I m very proud of her so I just wanted to give her those kudos Good job Still cuckoo I mean kudos Lots of kudos Now I feel we re on the same level Same place You ll never be at my level Hi How are you How are you It s good to see you Good to see you again Hi Hi What s the occasion So beautiful Our last visit I had to dress up We can show you the guest bedroom Yes definitely Beforehand I had to put blinders on to the clutter So now it s just it s night and day Oh my gosh It s all clear Look at this room All those cardboard boxes are gone Gone Yes a lot of moving around I love this house I love being here I love spending time here This process of looking at what s in our life makes it so that we re not gonna take the items we have for granted that we re not going to just bring more things into the household I love this dining room table It s beautiful You can see it now Yes There s some mental space that has been cleared up through this process and it was something that I ve needed for a very long time so it feels very good You go right ahead Wow The way we approach our house feels vastly different and sort of the way we re trying to live our lives feels vastly different Wow Amazing It s actually a very deep and meaningful change that we can carry with us going forward And it felt good to feel like if it s not bringing joy I can just go ahead and let it go I don t have to keep putting it back Let go It s easy If we have a third we can do this now because before it just felt like I m gonna put the bassinet on a pile of like junk and papers but now I feel very good that they would be well taken care of Like the other two You can actually see from one end to the next Look at this place How everything that was in here Oh my goodness We can park a car now I am speechless Aww My method of tidying really helps you not just clean the surface of your home but to really consider how you want to live and what kind of relationship you want have with your family with your friends and all the things that surround you So I m really happy and honored that you really absorbed that This process some ways has highlighted our opposite natures At the same time it did sort of help us better understand each other but also to work together in a meaningful way It was kinda nice because this is a great foundation to launch into the next stage Thank you for bringing your magic to us Thank you Thank you so much Thank you Bye thank you very much

every room So doesn t serve us really any purpose One thing that we re considering is it possibly being a nursery because we are expecting our first child Oh So Oh you have child We re carrying it right now Congratulations Thank you Thank you I think this is an excellent opportunity for you to tidy because my clients have told me that they re so glad that they got it over with before the baby Oh yeah Because of time Of course Yes I can understand because I have two babies Oh yeah Yeah You should expect to have a lot more things When your first child is born your world changes completely So you get to imagine what kind of parents you want to be or how you want to live as a family This is the excitement that parents get to experience as they tidy for their first child For me what changed after my daughters were born was that no matter how much I tidied my daughters would pull things out So keeping a tidy house became very difficult Okay so we ll go ahead and go upstairs Up here is two bedrooms Yeah We both have a lot of shoes so Oh So should we have shoe racks Yeah Call it the clutter room I like it Yeah he s so cool He s cool right That s what I saw This we use as a guest bedroom These are Mario s shoes So Ah Yes That s me I ve been collecting sneakers now for over years Oh years And it was a lot worse Now it s only about I ve been collecting sneakers since I was years old Put em down on the floor look at em Yeah That way you really know what you have I loved sneakers I loved sports I loved athletes These are the people I looked up to and it sounded so far fetched for me back then but I think when I became an adult and as I started having an income that was a priority and I started just kinda buying and it got maybe a little out of control Ninety five percent of them were never used never unlaced let alone ever tried on So more than anything I m ready to get started So first really look at all the shoes that you own Everything Alright we got some work You ll be able to do it trust me We trust you Yes Alright Let s go So tidying will begin now Yes Okay Before starting I would like to greet your house Okay Okay Greeting house is very important for me Okay good Thank you Thanks Thank you so much for giving me the time Sure No problem Okay so let s begin tidying Okay Oh my Let s go Ready What s first The first step is clothing Clothing ooh Okay Put them into a pile Okay Okay Down here Here Here All of your clothes Everything All the clothes All the clothes Okay Oh my That s a lot of clothes Marie I know Yes Yeah Okay We begin now Alright Okay let s go Oh God Can you take that off babe Yeah I can t reach Yeah Babe help I m trying I m trying I need your help of course Oh God So this will be Clarissa s mountain This isn t even close to all of it Cause we want everything Like drawers too Yes Wow Yes drawers everything This is gonna get in tomorrow Oh my Okay I see a unicorn outfit What is that It s a onesie It s a onesie That I ve never seen This ll be a lot of homework Dang it This girl is no joke This is giving me anxiety Deep breaths Alright you still It s still not as bad as Are you kidding This mess makes me it s kinda like I need to Everything needs to be out of here Yeah this is a lot Yeah Yeah But this is so important to see everything you have See it right it See yeah I knew we had a lot I didn t envision this Yeah When you see clothes laid out displayed entirely this is my life So from here on out you will be selecting things that sparks joy for you Okay Spark joy Spark joy So this is Yes Yes Yes Alright Yes Yes Yes Yes Keep He has a lot of clothes and I think a lot of the stuff going into the love love love and I m like where s the stuff you re getting rid of No No No Goodbye sir And this is goodbye Not yet Not yet Alright I m still yes no Like Touch it I don t know I might need it this summer This is hard This is sentimental What I recommend when that happens is to start with something that s really easy to make a quick decision There you go Oh yeah this is not fun Right now But I know I get it No That s a no I m saying goodbye Thank you Reluctantly that s a no Yeah Many people may feel guilty when letting go of items By expressing gratitude toward the items you let go it will lessen the feeling of guilt Thank you very much For example it s important to express gratitude toward clothes you never wore This is because the shirt taught you that you do not like to wear shirts like this By doing this it will become clear what is necessary for you So I think it s going pretty smoothly so I was thinking of assigning all the rest for homework Okay so we re done here right That s it right I m realizing a lot of these clothes I haven t touched in years Okay I have a lot of stuff man and I don t let go of things so it s gonna be hard It s gonna be rough Less clutter and more homework right Alright thank you Okay thank you Bye Have a good night Bye Bye guys Bye Bye No That s still a lot of shoes No No Starting to feel good about the process starting to really get rid of a lot of stuff Things that I haven t used whether it be clothing shoes you know some purses I m fine with getting rid of and just creating more space So I m not someone that s gonna hold onto something that I haven t used in years just because I want to keep it But I don t know if that s happened for Mario I m interested to see how quickly he s willing to actually get rid of something Because he s definitely got much more of an emotional attachment to things Come on Come on I m sorting You guys come here I m not gonna be able to do anything Oh Yeah this one I don t know if I can part ways with This one means a lot Cause despite whatever struggles or financial burdens my parents were going through I think actually my Dad might have been unemployed that Christmas And nonetheless I remember he took us to go buy These were real sacrifices that my parents were going through to sometimes just put a smile on our Me and my brother s face I ve kept things just because I do appreciate what my family has done My first Guatemala soccer jersey So it s not as easy as I thought it was gonna be to let go of some of this stuff Yeah But uh I guess you just sit back and trust the process Granted I haven t got to my shoes yet which I think is gonna be the hardest part But I think that uh I ll take my time with that I will say that But no that s staying That s Yeah Oh Hello Hello Hi How are you Hi Good How are you How s it going Nice to see you Nice to see you Hi Hi Hi Good to see you again How are you guys doing We re good Good I d love to see the closets first Okay If that s okay Closets alright Mine And then his is over Wow How did you feel sorting through your clothes and making selections I feel good It was nice to get rid of things that I don t use anymore and things that I know that I m not going to use so How about the clothes that you folded May I see those Yeah Yeah Okay so there is my dresser So all of this pretty much took up this whole drawer You are so great at folding Thank you I m surprised I m stunned The socks I can recommend another way Okay Ooh So just stack them together like this Fold in half Oh okay You see And then that way you can stack them all And also the band won t stretch out Yeah Yeah I throw away a lot of socks cause that happens Okay babe it s your turn Please Thank you Oh Yes the same method I think too Socks I ve done the same here I have socks bigger socks obviously How would you fold that technique that you were telling Clarissa with something like this For socks of this length I would recommend folding it in thirds Okay For thicker materials like this Okay thirds work And just file it as well Okay I think you guys are on a very very good pace But what s important is that you guys are motivated to transform your lives We are That s what matters the most So after clothes the next category is books right after that is paper documents Tidying together is a great way for couples to see if they share the same values From here I d like for them to learn the importance of working together Okay so I m gonna start moving the papers Just realized babe this is all your stuff This ain t none of mine The black stuff is yours Yeah that little container Oh jeez I hold on to note books I m just like you I have stickers Why My prom invitation You got stuff I think you can That I m keeping Shred Shred One thing for me I think which was so easy for me to kind of get rid of things is if I m looking at it and it s not something I like or not something that strikes anything in me I m fine with getting rid of it An unopened invitation to my brother s wedding I m keeping that one These are from all our holiday parties These are keep Argh But I don t know if Mario s fully there yet He s still not getting rid of things What s this little pile I see here hmm Oh this is just some stuff that needs to kinda find a place here in the house still It s a little frustrating just because we have a set timeline where we re gonna be expecting a baby in what five months I m worried because even though it s five months away like the days seem slow But then all of a sudden like a month goes by and I m like How did that happen Okay I m working on it babe I m working on laying on this couch Probably shouldn t be in the living room but I definitely hope that Marie really helps get him in line with what needs to be done because I could tell him ten times to move something or put it away and he s gonna do it when he wants to You still have homework to do Just you today Yes just me today Yes Okay I think your next assignment is gonna be miscellaneous items Okay Maybe garage That d be great Yes I d love to Excuse me Alright The garage seems to be a little neater Wow very clean We picked up a little bit Yeah Um our doggies are out here hanging out for now Mario I was wondering Yes Is there anything in here that you would let go Most of the stuff here still has function Like I have a lot of tile stored away here These are essential electrical supplies that we re gonna need once we redo this room so uh there is a purpose for all this stuff eventually Okay let s just take everything out Okay Anything you want to keep try to keep them in separate categories Separate categories Okay Yeah Uh and for the doggies Ah doggy Okay And this is a vintage clock that someone gave to me This is the alarm clock that woke me up every day for high school and I loved it so much I m just that kinda dude that attaches emotion to things you know I might be what some people call sentimental And I guess over the course of time I ve found it really hard to part ways with some of this stuff As scary as it is for me to admit I definitely need just an intervention Now here s a good question for you because this does have some type of sentimental value Ah Because this was the mailbox that was originally on the home when I purchased it So how do you feel about something like this So when you hold this in your hand does it still spark joy for you I guess joy wouldn t be the right word to identify this as to what it means to me because it s just a reminder of hey You know For what it s worth I never thought that you know to have my parents come from Guatemala and where they came from to be here in America now and have their home and you know have their son have his home three doors down from them is something that I think no way could they have ever fathomed or even thought of ever happening So that s why I guess little things like this mean something to me But this is something that you d like to keep as part of your life going forward When you put it that way no I can comfortably say that the mailbox I have outside is more joy than what this is because it s something that we did together I can let it go Thank you Through the Kondo process yes it s changing me as we speak and it s starting to make sense It s time to let go of some of this stuff I don t know who the Mario s gonna be after this process but it s uncharted territory and I m really kinda anxious to see where it ends I mean I was anxious to get here So now that we re here I feel like now I m gonna go through this as much and as hard as possible So next time you re here maybe it looks different Thank you Thank you Gracias Gracias And Mario right now is going through paperwork Huh babe Yeah Let the shredding commence Let the shredding commence The wheels are in motion and I m just seeing seeing and looking at things completely from a different perspective I m really second guessing everything as to why it s here why we re keeping things I ll keep That s it We have a lot more real estate here So here we go Trash Mario s about to dump a whole bunch of stuff in the trash I think Mario s mindset has definitely changed It was a bit hard at first for him to get rid of things but he s much better than before And Mario s much much more eager to get things done right then and there So I ve gone ahead and emptied all of the drawers here And got through everything in the kitchen And I m excited it looks completely different than what it looked like before I m more surprised about how Clari has come along in this whole process There s this driving force behind her and I can t help but to feed off of her I got a pregnant girl that s doing the work here The last thing I want her to do is feel stressed especially going through this pregnancy I want her to be confident knowing that I have her back and I m supportive with anything and everything that she might need There s our little guy Twelve weeks He s much bigger now Teeny tiny He s as big as a dollar bill today Obviously we re transitioning into parenthood and to have this kind of approach of tidying things up ultimately be part of our everyday kinda habits that s kind of the life I wanna lead you know when my son gets here Oh man Before the whole process even started I knew I was kinda hesitant to you know get started with what was gonna be addressing my shoe situation Oh man Because those are the ones that are dear to me that obviously has more sentiment behind um each and every one of those pairs of shoes But I think I m finally ready It s time to part ways and de clutter some of these shoes The first pair You ll stay here worth of credit card debt I remember that was the first time I realized I had a problem Debt to tennis shoes No that s not what I want my little man to think is what life is nah I don t ever want him to glorify anything materialistic That hurts Never got to wear you guys Well Some of these shoes have been with me God over three decades These are like childhood sneakers that I might have preserved because even though they weren t my size as an adult I still kept them just for the sake of what they were when I first was introduced to them or laid my eyes on them Almost the same exact shoe But now into my adulthood and let alone transitioning into the next chapter of my life which is fatherhood I realize that certain things have kind of served their purpose with me and I guess maybe that s more of an invitation now metaphorically to what s to come and just open to receiving whatever it is that comes my way that I m kind of detaching myself from what was that kinda like that mindset that I had when I was younger Hello What s up What are you doing Trying Looking at things differently Do we have a a uh give away or Yeah those don t keep These So you re giving away all the shoes that I ve actually seen you wear Yeah because I intend to wear the ones that I love now I m definitely proud of Mario because he s finally willing to part with shoes that he has held onto And the amount that he has chosen to get rid of to me was surprising because I didn t I d never seen that before so I certainly didn t expect him to get rid of as much as he did So that was that was surprising to me This has never happened with this pair of shoes Do they fit Yes Like a glove You bought those what four years ago Yeah And if that doesn t tell you something I ve never even put em on It feels good There are many people like Mario who want to display their shoes This arrangement creates an aesthetic balance to the shoe rack Hello hello Ah hello Hi Hi How are you How are you doing I m doing really well Good good The house is yours for you to run through it and see what you think And please we re always ears to anything that you re gonna counsel us to do I m most interested in the rooms upstairs Phenomenal Wow Yeah I think I took the most from this process just because I uh I did have a lot of stuff Where I started I was over pairs of sneakers and that s now chipped away to probably like below It feels good I have an appreciation now for the things that I did keep and most importantly it made things easy to part with Wow this area changed so much And so I don t ever see myself going back to the way I was before Marie came into our lives Just the techniques we ve learned you know folding the clothes I think it s just gonna make it a lot easier for us to continue to keep the house you know clean and in order The kitchen is probably the biggest change I m really happy that the kitchen looks the way it does now The counter tops are as you know empty as they can be The cabinets are organized You ve worked so hard you guys Thank you Oh Clarissa Okay Wow Yes I think this is remarkably done Mm hmm I love walking in here now I literally have come here just to grab a chair sit on my phone and just hang out in here So I just want to commend you Mario because how I remember this garage was on the first day to this dramatic change It was bad This is very impressive Great job on the garage Thank you Thank you He passed right He more than passed Very good With flying colors I can t believe how much progress we ve made from what the house looked like to you know once Marie got here to what we ve been able to do now So I m just completely surprised had no idea it would end up looking like this Alright I can clearly see that you guys both worked so hard in the tidying process It was a bit stressful cause it was just so much at once um but I m very happy with the end result I feel like of everything is where it needs to be so I don t feel as overwhelmed with the amount of work that we need to do to ultimately like clean The office area since that s looking like it s gonna be the final spot for the nursery It s I mean obviously not ready for us to do that yet The desk is in there there is stuff that just needs to not be in there but it s very close But I think now you said you re there but the road to I think it s very clear Yeah I have every faith that you can finish I know that along this process we ve gotten stronger I am so eager and so motivated now more than ever to just plow through as much as I possibly can in terms of addressing things and projects around the home Just to see it just coming to fruition it s just it s so Such a good feeling and I m hooked on that feeling right now We ll be done before the baby s here Yes And much before the baby gets here because we do wanna enjoy this free time that we now have So is it okay if I ask when the baby is due In August So do you wanna go grab the new pictures Would you like to see him Yes I ll get em This is a great timing that you finished this Yeah that s what we re thinking That s why you know we re kind of putting deadlines on all the other things we wanna get done to just Please enjoy Here let s put em down there Put em on the table I can see the face Oh my gosh It s a person Oh there he is So yeah he is a boy Oh I can see What an amazing thing to look forward to Thank you Thank you so much I m honored So gracias Gracias Muchas gracias Muchas gracias Yes to you Thank you Do you know how to say spark joy in Spanish Te T E Te Trae Trae Alegria Te trae alegria That s lovely I love the sound of that Mario and Clarissa learned the tools to create their ideal life through this tidying process Even though they are still not completely finished I m sure by the time their son arrives their home will be ready I hope Mario Clarissa and their son will continue to spark a lot of joy in their future Take me away Don t be afraid Cause they always say Let go of your fears Cause we all make mistakes in life But if we re ever gonna get it right We re gonna give it all another try That s what I m dreaming of Follow all the things you love Love love Love love 
 Ah She looks excited I m so excited because I love mess It s a never ending battle to fight the clutter Oh I want things to be more simple I don t know how to fix it With the baby coming it s gonna be more chaos Oh my God We have too much stuff Hello I m Marie Kondo My mission is to spark joy in the world through cleaning Ching Best selling author and world renowned tidying expert Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring the world to choose joy with the KonMari Method A feature of the KonMari Method is that you clean by item and not by location And we will always clean using the same categories First it s clothing I can t reach Next is books Giving them a little shake and wake them up Then paper I can t do the papers The largest category is komono Komono is kitchen bathroom and garage Everything miscellaneous Finally sentimental items It s kinda hard to let it go cause I really like this one This is kinda hard I don t want to just you know dump it But I want to be thoughtful about it From the moment she set foot in our house she had this presence to her She wants to see this place turned around Marie brought a whole bunch of joy upon our home This is amazing You re so cute I love you You re so cute I love you too These are like happy happy tears Thank you for what you ve brought to our home really The KonMari Method is a means to realize your ideal life My clients this time Angela and Alishia are newlyweds They recently purchased a condo for their new home They are a lovely couple but they are having trouble figuring out how they can turn their new home into a comfortable space for both of them Through tidying I m looking forward to helping them create a comfortable home Hi Hi Hello I m Marie Angela Nice to meet you Nice to meet you Hi I m lida Miss Marie s interpreter Hi lida Nice to meet you Angela We re very excited to have you here Yes Alright come on in Thank you We do have a kitty cat Hi Hi Hi Kitty Nice to meet you I m Marie Alishia Pleased to meet you Hi I m lida Miss Marie s interpreter Nice to meet you lida Alishia Oh you have two dogs Our puppies out there So the big one is London and the little one is Teddy and you ve met kitten Earl I m Angela I m a veterinarian I m Alishia I m a flight attendant I was working a flight from Vegas to Atlanta and she was my passenger and she was all like Hey cute stuff I was like Hey girl That s not how I remember it Oh my gosh really I mean it s close enough That was what five years ago Mm hmm Prior to Angela I was considered a nomad I feel like I literally grabbed her out of the sky and brought her down to earth Oh yes We recently just got married last June We ve literally married Married our lives together So we are new homeowners About a month ago we ve closed escrow on our new place So this is that first step into adulthood that we re We ve heard so much about Just in these last couple of weeks we ve been moving and things are everywhere The transition has been semi stressful You know it s Very stressful Okay Very stressful That s why it s critical for us to get our space organized and live in ready because it s a new chapter You don t want to start the new chapter disorganized or chaotic With old stuff We want that easy breezy We want to be able to come into our space and definitely feel relaxed you know So how long has it been since you moved here Uh It s only been three weeks We just moved here Three weeks Yes Gosh so you just moved in Yes Wow So as soon as I entered this room it seems perfectly organized and tidy Is is Do you really have a problem with tidying Oh you ll see Should we give you a little tour Yes please The struggle We call this the struggle room I see I m starting to see now The good stuff Yeah Ninety percent of those are mine Those are mostly mine Here are the shoes Clothes Clothes Mostly mine Well Mine Mine mine Ours more winter stuff So how do you use this room right now We don t We want this room to be kinda like the office slash guest space slash closet Yes there s a lot of cloudiness here in this room So we ll figure that out Don t fall on anything We tried to organize this space a little bit So how do you use this space My pants and then Those are my jeans on that side Yeah Usually we find ourselves in a closet battle For instance we share belts like belts and socks and accessories and things I ll ask her where the belts are cause my belts that she doesn t wear are in a spot so we have like separate belts and we have belts together The belts together get lost Although we ve been together for so many years we never got to organize We re gonna have clothes in both rooms You wanna put your shirt on over there pants over here How do you want this to work I ve kinda just been grabbing the outfit together Like I grab a shirt come in here and grab some pants and get dressed in the room I m just saying you don t want Some cohesiveness Yeah I do but I just I just want everything put away right now It causes tension It causes tension So the general impression that I got from your closet is that a lot of your things are mixed together and it s a little difficult to determine oh what s inside Yeah Yes Yes A tip on sharing closet space with a partner is to designate areas for each person For example in this closet I can t reach the top rack so I will choose to use the bottom rack By doing this it is easy to see how much clothing you have Aw This is kind of our stress free area We wanted to ensure we had a place in the house to kinda get away from all of the moving and so we put this together first Okay You got it So this is the only part where it s kind of like hers and mine Yeah clothes are mine I feel like we organize things a little differently like she will put things in a different spot than me and I think that s how we get kind of our wires crossed I would recommend making this particular closet all of Alishia s clothes And then that way Angela could have the guest bedroom space Ultimately that would be the simplest solution Goody Okay When tidying each individual should be responsible for their own space This lessens the tension and increases their sense of trust and bonding The kitchen It could be better This has room for improvement definitely That s actually a problem area So do these items belong to the both of you or does one person have more than the other I would say maybe both The kitchen was kinda split Yeah Half is mine half is hers We re definitely complete opposites when it comes to like organizing And it s frustrating We need help categorizing what stuff needs to go with what stuff I really feel that the presence of this home is so important You mentioned that this is your first home that you ve purchased so this is a very significant space So I would like to take this time to formally introduce myself to your home Okay Okay It s only been three weeks right Yup Yes If that s the case I think it would be much better if you do this with me Okay Okay let s do it Let s gather here in the middle Just tell your home your intention for it and your hopes for it She ll meditate for a while You guys left me How did you feel Inspired Excited Yeah I just saw order Yeah Yeah Relaxed I hope you ll keep all the feelings that you felt in your heart as we go through the tidying because tidying isn t just about organizing your home It s about creating a welcoming inviting positive environment into your home Yay Take out every single last piece of clothes Oh lordy help me What s your anxiety level right now We re gonna lose Marie in the pile Holy macaroni I told you you have more clothes than me I know I have more clothes than you I think we have it all We re gonna be going through these clothes piece be piece When you hold each item in your hands ask if it sparks joy for you Okay I can do that We can just start right from the top Yes Yes yes Yes yes yes And all of these yeses Angela let s get started with your pile then Okay Oh Okay Clothes for me are just functional because I m not very attached to material things So I don t have very many clothes in general just because I m wearing scrubs four days out of the week I don t have dresses and shirts and pants and stuff like that I don t like to get dressed up too much Ask if it sparks joy for you I like it but I really I don t wear it as often I can let you go You can be happy for somebody else Thank you Thank you She let the Redskins go Get out of my space Goodness I pride myself on my eclecticness because I do wear a uniform and so I don t really get to wear my clothes too much and I feel like even though I m not wearing the clothes all the time it s still like an expression of my personality Right how are we doing Question there s some things that I m holding onto There s one dress in particular I wanted to show you This is actually the little dress My grandmother bought me this Ah I love Isn t it so cute I love it it s lovely But it s also too small so I just remember wanting it really bad and she kinda gave me that look She was like Go try it on So I go try it on and she goes Okay you can have it Are you very close to your grandmother I was she passed away in This is probably like close to the oldest thing in my closet The point of this process isn t to force yourself to eliminate things It s really to confirm how you feel about each and every item that you possess I m just gonna look at you a little longer Just a little longer Marie helping us tackle the biggest challenge which is our closet space and the actual organization is so refreshing I m excited to put everything where it needs to be Bye see you soon See you soon Bye Okay you ready to get this homework done Where do I put my keep stuff I love my clothes I know when it touches my body I m like Ooh I get it I get it So that that feeling that she said that you should feel that is that s joy I feel that with a lot of my items For instance this particular dress I was probably or when my grandmother purchased it But it was just that memory of being with her And my grandmother loved clothes so we have that in common So It s kinda hard to let it go cause I really like this one And I wear it all the time That s probably why it s faded too But This just takes me back to a time with her and not really I mean I spent a lot of time with her but I just want it Just I always remember I think I might cry now You okay So you didn t just You okay Aww It s okay Hi Hi How are you Hi Oh my goodness gracious London come on let s go Let s go outside honey Teddy London outside let s go Go Git There you go How s it going How was the homework Um Well First things first these items are the things that we ve touched on and loved on and thanked but they no longer serve a purpose for us so we re actually in the process of donating That s great Okay I d love to see the rest Great Okay I was wondering what did you do with the dress that your grandmother gave you I still have it It s just next to the bed I knew I was gonna go through the changes in my mind and in my body especially with my clothes because I do I love my clothes But I have to learn to extract the memory from an item That dress brings up my grandmother and I guess it s just more of a sad place because she s no longer here I am gonna donate or give away or if anyone wants it It s healthy to revisit and to remember and obviously I want a part of my grandmother to be in my home but there are a lot of different things that could remind me of her A question I had what is the best way to fold the hoodies because they get so bulky and I feel like it doesn t remain folded So there are two ways to store hoodies You can store them in drawers or you can pile them together If you were storing them in drawers aim for that rectangle in the middle fold towards the center tuck the hood in and roll into thirds so you can file them vertically in the drawer if you like Okay And then what is the best way to fold undergarments I consider bras very important for women so I like to file them in a way that really truly sparks joy Bras are special items for women So let s store them with VIP treatment When storing bras arrange them in a way where you don t smoosh the cups It ll spark joy if you arrange them in a way that creates a color gradient Let s fold the cupless bras Fold it in half and tuck in the straps They can be stored in this way For soft cup bras Fold it in half tuck in the straps then roll it up for a refreshing way to store it When storing bras if you put them in boxes it ll look more organized Okay Just a little quick peek And most importantly shoes What happened to those The shoes are still mixed What we are trying to figure out is if it ll be easier to leave in the shoe box or to take the shoes out I will make this my homework and think about it So okay leave that up to me Don t worry too much about the storage solution So today I d like to move onto the miscellaneous items and I recommend tackling the kitchen Okay Just take everything out even the tupperwares everything out and just go through them and ask yourself if you see any items that don t belong to your life ahead that you don t necessarily feel like it should be a part of your life going forward Okay Now Some spices Um we have some pantry items Oh I see If there are any expired items this is a great opportunity to toss them Oh for sure The main tip on organizing the pantry is to categorize food items For example the drinks category such as coffee and tea Cereals and snacks Pasta flour and other carbohydrates And finally canned foods For small items such as snacks if you put them in boxes it ll be easier to access and it ll look more organized By storing your food like this it will make it easy to keep track of the quantity of food you have Next time I m here I will have solutions for you in terms of storage for all your miscellaneous items See you next week Next time Thank you guys Bye bye Bye Bye bye Okay We have more homework to do More homework Oh goodness It s about to go down Soy sauce Soy This is disgusting Throw it away Why Oh Why Alishia Don t why me We don t eat ketchup Is there ketchup in the refrigerator Yes there is You know what ketchup You don t bring me joy anymore Oh my gosh Uh oh Don t even look What is that Gravy Turkey gravy slow cooker There you go You ve got turkey gravy from I feel like you ve been holding onto that turkey gravy just to be spiteful We need to figure out Stop sliding that Ugh Pick it up Put it in the back I don t reach Oh my goodness Short people Angela and I have a disconnect on where do we put these items Her access is different from my access Basic access is height We have a lot of cabinet space where I can put stuff higher and reach things but she does more of the cooking so it needs to be where she can reach it Unless she doesn t want me to touch it And then I just put it really high Like my things Don t touch my stuff Alishia Have you gone through these glasses Yeah They don t look like you went through em Don t sort my things sort your things kay Oh those are fighting words Don t sort my things hmm hmm hmm Meow We disagree on Organization where things should go and how things should be done If I had to give you an example of what type of person I think Angela is she will put a blender in the linen closet Why is this here Well all the electronics are in there So in her mind it makes sense And then in mine I m like No It made sense at the time and so I did it You can get rid of those pink ones What about these dirty yellow ones You re sorting my stuff again Jesus let go of it Let go You are real judgy today Well These are actually like seeing glasses These are not for style Why don t you just put them all in there You have a problem with wanting to put things in different places One of the things that Marie made very clear is that even though you have different ideas like items need to be together here So once we sift through that a little more with time I think we ll be good Hi Hello Hi Come on in Come on in welcome welcome welcome Hi Come on in Nice to see you Wow You guys brought gifts Yes many of them Let s get right into it Yeah What s our next dilemma Shoes When storing all these shoes try to imagine what a store display would look like So just keep the similar colors together same types of shoes together So the shoe boxes Can we keep the shoe boxes Yeah So like that right Right So we could just put the shoe box here and then the shoes on top The only thing about this shelf are the heels I actually have the same rack in my closet too and that s always been my problem that I have Oh snap Look at that Even these you can fit and it won t fall through Okay Wow You solved that problem so fast For me in my house I tend to use pretty postcards or things that spark joy for me Oh nice okay I can do that What should we move onto now I d like to continue with the lesson on komono Yes So I don t know what to do with our dog items cause they are in multiple places Let s take a look Oh they re getting excited That s my stuff So we have three fur babies Welcome to our family Right Um untraditional but traditional at the same time We re like the Brady Bunch It was really important finding a space that they could We could all co habitate together Um so the balconies are really nice cause they can go outside on the balconies and kinda get that airspace It s important that we get the space together for them too Oh yes Cause as you can see they re up in everything Oh yes So what s in here What s in this basket So they have a lot of toys and I want them to be able to get them But I also want the toys out the way I don t know how she found all these balls Well granted at our last place we lived next to a tennis court Can you select how many tennis balls you need One Just one She wants her tennis balls I would say more than that because sometimes at the park they get nasty and we don t want to bring it home Two Three Mhm Three tennis balls Three okay You definitely use these for walks right The leashes Yes And so we have We just need to put it somewhere So for the kitten and doggie supplies I think using this whole section for their items would be best Just hanging them right here and putting the leash will help identify this section When tidying pet supplies it s important to create a space for them Here s a tip for storing pet items For example you can put toys here This is a toy Leashes go here Grooming and food supplies here If you divide the space it ll look more tidy For dogs you take them on a walk every day so you can put leashes on a hook and put them on the wall I never got a chance to use a leash like this because I only had eel like fish as pets when I was little You want to go to the master bath Let s take a look Sure The bathroom is kind of a mixed use space Angela is a groomaholic So for instance hairbrushes shampoos conditioners The woman is insane My bathroom needs to be organized I need to be an arm reach away from She uses so many products my brush and my gel and my hair lotion I need contact solution I need this I need that I need I m like Oh I don t want anything on the bathroom counter I like cohesiveness and she just likes accessibility So these items here Angela uses these daily Hmm Along with these daily And then we have the makeup brushes and lipsticks Oh more hair stuff Oh that s like my hair stuff So the point here for storage in the bathroom is to section it off with smaller boxes and utilize the space that way Game changer We need a lot of those Yes Let s stack them Game changer I m never gonna throw away a box again Yeah it makes sense now As soon as she put that little box in there it all just came full circle I was like Ah I like that Yeah Okay We re moving on Now with the bathroom even though we re in the same drawer we re still separated That way it s not messy You know it s You still have your little bit of space You want me to take something for you Thank you The cool part has definitely been organizing um as opposed to kinda letting go of things Since all of our stuff was together I think you know we blended but now that we have our designated spaces but we still have our communal things everything else is just gonna fall into place So we are going all drinkware here all food items here and dishes are staying there Yeah We work well together when we have a clear path Let s get to it let s chop chop Big big Small small The common goal was this is our home and we want it to be ease for both of us We like straws Boxes Bam High five Mm We want to be able to move maneuver without you know restrictions Now it s like all the things that we love sparks that ding The what Ding That s like my favorite thing like Ding It s all Alishia s stuff that has to move You just seem so excited about that I want a little corner that s all to call my own This is your corner Yeah it s my corner now Our biggest headache was her getting her closet in order and then me getting my closet in order And so once we got things separated we can kind of do our own thing I ve taken my things out of the dresser so this is gonna be all Angela s items Aren t you happy You get your own space I m so excited to have some space Things had to get worse first before we started to really understand what the process was about knowing that you know we are doing this journey together but we do have an individual journey that we need to take before we kinda get together and tackle the things that we co own I am exhausted from a hard day s work Alishia she s determined to get this shelf in order The bickering is It s slowly on the decline I love her more Do ya I do I didn t think that was possible You d be surprised what a little organization could do So obviously our wedding book wedding gift book remember I think we kind of actually started organizing in the same you know the same fashion now as well Mm hmm Marie is gonna be so excited I hope she likes it Everybody s knocked out Marie s here Hi Hi Marie How are you Good to see you Welcome Hi Good to see you How are you Good how are you

everything is it s perfect Mhm Things you eat with Oh look how neat it looks I remember at first the biggest task was I don t organize like she does Right And vice versa And now we kinda see eye to eye on Everything is right here Right and it makes sense to be right there Yeah common ground on organization Yeah Ready to move on Yeah That second room we kept the door shut because we didn t want to see all that stuff Goodness gracious This is amazing Now we can actually Walk in there I leave the door open now cause I like looking at the space Look how well you ve used the space Now you know where everything is Oh yeah It s easy to find I m excited for people to come and see this Look what I did We did a good job Honey Yeah Yeah We re a couple we re together we share a lot of things together but everything got a lot better when we designated our own spaces Look how neat and simple it looks when you open the closet I love it It s amazing We don t really have to struggle through the other person s things to get to our own To just kinda have that individuality has kinda made a world of difference That was the biggest transformation I think So going through the process took care of a lot of those little blips and stresses It s also like soothing to open the drawer because you know it s in order We ve gained a deeper respect for each other s belongings and we really got to learn a lot about each other in that process as well and see why that item brings them joy So it was really therapeutic in our relationship as far as just getting to know each other a little bit better We re so grateful for you to come in and just show us something we thought we possessed within ourselves but we just didn t know how to exert it You gave us the tools that we needed to really put things together I think when we first came in and we welcomed the home and we really wanted to envision the space I think we re coming to that point where this is how we wanted the space to be Oh
