My family has lived in a house for 19 years. Now 2 of us need to downsize into an apartment.,"I've spent most of my life in this house, but we have to move into an apartment for now. The buyers just agreed to the sale and we are applying to the apartment we have decided on later tonight. I will be moving in with my mom. (My dad and brother don't live with us.) 

I'm rather frightened that we have too much stuff. My mom hoards random old things her parents, grandparents, and beyond owned. I am more of a naturalist, so I hoard stones, bones, interesting woods, etc. I also have shells, but I downsized them significantly recently.

Our garage is so chock-full of stuff she wants to take with her that we can barely move around in it. To give you an idea of how much that is, it was designed to accommodate two cars. We need to figure out what is actually essential for an apartment, and what can be replaced. There are some sentimental things that she absolutely will not give up, like baby clothes. But that heavy chandelier so old and fragile you're afraid to use it? Yeah, that needs to go. 

My rock collection is pretty big and I want to keep at least one specimen of each type of rock I have. The rest I might give out to neighbor kids or something.

I found a closet/clothes system that works for me.,"It took years for me to work this out, but this is the 4th year in this **three room house** (**560sf)** and the closet and clothes are one of the few things that don't give me aggravation.

 [https://imgur.com/a/3eN9lmx](https://imgur.com/a/3eN9lmx) 

There is a cedar chest underneath the hanging clothes and a row of shelves down one side of the closet and coat hooks on the other side.  I also have a very small chest of drawers next to it.  My rule is ALL of my clothes must fit in the space allowed.  

Twice a year I pull all my clothes out of the closet, inspect them and change them over for season.  

All the shoes and boots are on the shelves. I take them out and give them a scrub and brush up when the seasons change.  On the side with the hooks are umbrella, luggage, totebags, belts, tripod bag etc.. 

The winter sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves went into the cedar chest.  Also in there are a small number of nice clothes that I REALLY expect to fit into sometime this year. knock wood. 

At the extreme edges of the closet are my outwear, winter coats, rain coats, light jackets and sweaters. The layers sort of works in towards the middle, so the nice t-shirts are in the center.  

Towards the center are trousers on one side, casual and dress, shirts on the other, short sleeved, long sleeved and sleeveless. 

When I rotate them I try everything on that I haven't worn recently and if I still haven't worn it in over a year, it gets **marikondo'd**. 

I also try to limit it to 5-6 pieces of any TYPE, that's really what I have been wearing on a rotation anyway.  Any more choices and I end up with clothes that never gets worn.  Mixed in there are specialty clothes for hiking or cycling as well as clothes for interviews and funerals.  

If something is damaged or doesn't fit - I may add it to the list of things I want to replace.  (I also have a small pile to REPAIR)   Since I'm not very fashionable, it's easy for me to to keep certain TYPES of clothing and stay within a color palatte so that everything can be worn with everything else.

The 4 drawers in the chest hold the NON hangables, socks, underwear in the divided one, T-shirts in the next, sweats and shorts in the next and the bottom one has cotton sweaters, pajamas, other stuff.    I think it was a bureau from a child's bedroom set.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was very proud of myself today because it's taking me less and less time to do this every year. I have my rules already made up so I spend very little time debating about what stays and what goes into the donation bag.

Just purged even more books and opened my already massive amount of book credits to the public,"Just thought I'd share this with you guys,

Today I dropped even more books off at the cool and awesome used book store here in my town. 

I used to spend all of my money there buying new and used books for my acting classes. 

When you ""sell"" a book, Instead of giving money, they give you used book credit, which you can use to buy any of thier used books with. When they saw how many acting and drama books I brought in, they suggested that I could also open my credits to the public.

So I walked back home again and gave away even more books than I originally planned. 

Instead of:

 ""Oh boo hoo... I'll miss this..."" it turned into:

""Gee, what else can I give so any poor struggling actors (like me) can be able to get the most out of my teeny tiny scholarship fund?"" 

Now my account with them is set up so that if any customer wants to buy a used drama book, they get access to my credits, so its an automatic 50% off of the used book. 

Win-win for everybody!

It feels good to rehome my unused books and others I don't want to keep lugging around, and know that my fellow thespians will be able to benefit!

Mini tip for a tidier house,"I can't remember where I originally saw this so can't give credit.  But I've taken up a new habit to help keep my house clean and tidy. Never leave a room empty handed. So as you're leaving the living room, pick up the coffee cup and take it back to the kitchen. When you leave the kitchen, take the dish towel and throw it in the laundry as you walk past. If there's nothing to take anywhere, tidy one thing before you leave, something tiny, like the makeup brush that is sitting on the table and not in the holder, or the pair of undies that landed next to the laundry basket, not in it. These teeny tiny little habits all add up to a much neater space! I'm really noticing the difference! Hope this is helpful :) ",declutter,1553915181,Hoppinginpuddles,52,54,True,b76dyj,2019-03-29,"Mini tip for a tidier house I can't remember where I originally saw this so can't give credit.

Rules and why you should get some.,"I just spent an entire day looking for the only **car key** ....INSIDE MY HOUSE.   In the end I found it, but in the mean time I was imagining my life going forward not being able to afford to replace it right away ($120 JUST for the key and more for the fob) and what I would do until I did replace it. How would I get to work, the laundry etc... as a side activity my brain was wondering where the hell it could have gotten to!!

&amp;#x200B;

Lets go back to the beginning.  I have not only reached the age where I forget things, but I have  always had a certain level of ADHD where I get busy with something and can easily put something in the wrong place and be unaware that I did it.  For this and may other reasons...I HAVE RULES.    

&amp;#x200B;

**The Car Key Rule:.** This car came with one key...a very expensive one, the key not the car... It can ONLY be in one of three places... in my bag hanging on the back of the kitchen door, in the pocket of whatever coat I happen to be wearing lately, also hanging on the back of the kitchen door OR on a rare occasion ON the kitchen table.  So I searched the pockets of the two coats on the back of the door, I searched my bag (4 times), my camera bag, all the empty grocery bags, even the bags of laundry which I had loaded into the car.  I searched the CAR and all the things IN the car, I searched the ground between the house and the car, I searched the kitchen table, I even searched the trash...the icky trash. I swept and washed the kitchen floor, and then I spent the rest of the day going through all the tool boxes under the kitchen table ...then for good measure I cleaned some of the tools before putting them back in their homes.    WHILE I was at the sink washing everything that needed a good angry scrub...I remembered that the weather was NICE yesterday and I wore a hoodie which I had put it away IN THE CLOSET instead of hanging it in the kitchen.... and I knew it would be in the pocket before I actually looked.  So the rule worked.  I just forgot what I was wearing yesterday. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rules.**  I have a lot of rules, for a lot of reasons not just decluttering.  I am not forgetful overall, I actually have a brain filled with more information than a normal person should have... but I get distracted and I also DITHER about decisions.  The great thing about rules is that is a decision that is already made and I don't have to dither about it, I just have to remember the rule. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides **the CAR KEY Rule**, the irreplacable items in my life have similar strict rules.  **My wallet, my phone** and **my eyeglasses** are also not allowed to be put just anywhere.  Although my glasses are allowed  to live in my knitting bag when not on my face.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The US Mail Rule:** US mail comes into the house, junk mail, flyers, etc go straight in the recycling.  First class important mail, goes in my bag on the back of the door to be addressed, or it goes in a special place I put things I want to ignore or  VERY Important Mail gets put on the fridge under a magnet where I can glare at it.    Packages get opened immediately, and the packing material goes into the recycling.  Catalogs I actually WANT to read, or papers or magazines I bring home go on the table next to the reading chair, after a week, they get tossed read or not.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kitchen Table Rule:**  Kitchen table gets completly cleaned off everyday, several times a day sometimes, since it's my only work bench. Right now the only things that reside there are the kitchenaid and the bread making bowls.  But they get pulled off when I have to sand and wash the table.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kitchen Counter Rule**: ...i don't really have a rule...basically I keep it as clean as possible.  The cats don't get on it when I am looking but I imagine they do when I am not looking.  So I wipe the entire thing down, before I cook anything everytime.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kitchen Sink Rule**:  I wash the dishes twice a day - I clean out the sink before I START cooking, then I wash everything in the sink AFTER I finish cooking. That allows me to just toss things into the sink after dinner or breakfast, but they will get washed before I make dinner again.  So I am partway lazy.   The corrollary rule about dishes and things is that EVERYTHING fits in a cabinet or hangs on a rack, if something doesn't fit, something needs to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hang Everything Rule:**  If at all possible hang things up. I have had pets and done rescue work for a very long time, they are cruel and unreasonable roommates; anything I care about has to be hung up.  Coats, bags, knitting bags, camera bags, all hung from strategically placed coathooks, the same ones everytime. Besides the closet rod, I added two rods across the two doorways in my house using pvc and closet rod sockets, - this gives me a place to hang anything that is in transition - sheets, blankets, sleeping bags, damp clothes, whatever - but nothing just gets left in a pile or thrown over the furniture.   I also used the pvc/rod sockets to add a pot/utensil rack over the sink.   Some things that hang up:  The broom hangs on the back of the cellar door, the Flashlight hangs next to the front door, the Dog Leash hangs on the back of the door, The lunch bag hangs up in the kitchen with the empty food containers inside, the umbrella hangs up inside the closet.  The kitchen towels live in a bag that hangs on the wall. The rechargable drill lives hung up on a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tote Bag Rules**:  I keep tote bags and reusable grocery bags on the door knobs in the kitchen (my kitchen has a lot doors)  when I decree something is leaving, getting donated, or given away, I put it in a tote bag.   When I leave the house any bags with stuff go with me.    I am lucky I have a vehicle so I can leave something in the car until it gets delivered. But once it's in the car I make a serious effort to drop it off.  

Also hanging on the door handles is the library book bag, and a bag with the dog's sweaters and leashes.  Just loose ONE library book, ONE time and you get paranoid about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Out the Door Rule:**  if something LEAVES the house, it can't come back. I have a very tiny house, when I decided something has to leave, there is just no place for it to hang  out.  I miss my garage and my covered porches something fierce. When I do a BIG clean, I take things straight out the door to the porch.  If something can get to the thrift store or junk yard - it still stays out there, and I cover it with a tarp or trash bag.  In my experience if I just push things around inside the house or put it in the cellar or attic, then it NEVER LEAVES. So the door is like an airlock.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are more rules, these help with the clutter inside the house.  Most of my rules exist to control what comes INTO the house which is where I faulter.   I am a thrift store addict, I have given up trying to resist, I just make more rules.

The great thing about rules is that is a decision that is already made and I don't have to dither about it, I just have to remember the rule. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides **the CAR KEY Rule**, the irreplacable items in my life have similar strict rules.  **My wallet, my phone** and **my eyeglasses** are also not allowed to be put just anywhere.  Although my glasses are allowed  to live in my knitting bag when not on my face.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The US Mail Rule:** US mail comes into the house, junk mail, flyers, etc go straight in the recycling.  First class important mail, goes in my bag on the back of the door to be addressed, or it goes in a special place I put things I want to ignore or  VERY Important Mail gets put on the fridge under a magnet where I can glare at it.    Packages get opened immediately, and the packing material goes into the recycling.  Catalogs I actually WANT to read, or papers or magazines I bring home go on the table next to the reading chair, after a week, they get tossed read or not.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kitchen Table Rule:**  Kitchen table gets completly cleaned off everyday, several times a day sometimes, since it's my only work bench. Right now the only things that reside there are the kitchenaid and the bread making bowls.  But they get pulled off when I have to sand and wash the table.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kitchen Counter Rule**: ...i don't really have a rule...basically I keep it as clean as possible.  The cats don't get on it when I am looking but I imagine they do when I am not looking.  So I wipe the entire thing down, before I cook anything everytime.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kitchen Sink Rule**:  I wash the dishes twice a day - I clean out the sink before I START cooking, then I wash everything in the sink AFTER I finish cooking. That allows me to just toss things into the sink after dinner or breakfast, but they will get washed before I make dinner again.  So I am partway lazy.   The corrollary rule about dishes and things is that EVERYTHING fits in a cabinet or hangs on a rack, if something doesn't fit, something needs to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Hang Everything Rule:**  If at all possible hang things up. I have had pets and done rescue work for a very long time, they are cruel and unreasonable roommates; anything I care about has to be hung up.  Coats, bags, knitting bags, camera bags, all hung from strategically placed coathooks, the same ones everytime. Besides the closet rod, I added two rods across the two doorways in my house using pvc and closet rod sockets, - this gives me a place to hang anything that is in transition - sheets, blankets, sleeping bags, damp clothes, whatever - but nothing just gets left in a pile or thrown over the furniture.   I also used the pvc/rod sockets to add a pot/utensil rack over the sink.   Some things that hang up:  The broom hangs on the back of the cellar door, the Flashlight hangs next to the front door, the Dog Leash hangs on the back of the door, The lunch bag hangs up in the kitchen with the empty food containers inside, the umbrella hangs up inside the closet.  The kitchen towels live in a bag that hangs on the wall. The rechargable drill lives hung up on a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tote Bag Rules**:  I keep tote bags and reusable grocery bags on the door knobs in the kitchen (my kitchen has a lot doors)  when I decree something is leaving, getting donated, or given away, I put it in a tote bag.   When I leave the house any bags with stuff go with me.    I am lucky I have a vehicle so I can leave something in the car until it gets delivered. But once it's in the car I make a serious effort to drop it off.  

Also hanging on the door handles is the library book bag, and a bag with the dog's sweaters and leashes.  Just loose ONE library book, ONE time and you get paranoid about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Out the Door Rule:**  if something LEAVES the house, it can't come back. I have a very tiny house, when I decided something has to leave, there is just no place for it to hang  out.  I miss my garage and my covered porches something fierce. When I do a BIG clean, I take things straight out the door to the porch.  If something can get to the thrift store or junk yard - it still stays out there, and I cover it with a tarp or trash bag.  In my experience if I just push things around inside the house or put it in the cellar or attic, then it NEVER LEAVES. So the door is like an airlock.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are more rules, these help with the clutter inside the house.  Most of my rules exist to control what comes INTO the house which is where I faulter.   I am a thrift store addict, I have given up trying to resist, I just make more rules.

I have honestly not stopped cleaning, organizing, &amp; decluttering for the last 4-5 hours.

I can stop now.” I still have over half of the stuff I need to accomplish tonight left to do 😭 being a student and trying to declutter to clear my head seems absolutely impossible at this point.

Can I put some books in your attic?,"Here’s a story that I thought might fit here. I have a good friend from high school who’s mom passed from cancer our junior year. That’s pretty terrible, but a few years go by, we’ve moved out and life goes on.  

Last summer I was home from college, and my friend was in town too, so naturally he’s over a lot. It turns out his dad is moving, so he had to get rid of some things, and the stuff he was getting rid of included my friend’s mom’s books. My friend didn’t want to get rid of them, but he couldn’t take them with him (he lives in military barracks), so he asks my mom if he can put the books in our attic until he has somewhere to, which she says is fine.

A few days later, my dad and I are hanging out in the garage, when my friend comes by in his pick up truck, and the bed is absolutely packed with cardboard boxes full of books. It’s an insane amount, and I have no doubt if you were to weight them out they would weigh thousands of pounds.

Anyway, my dad ran in and asked my mom if she had any idea what she agreed to, and all of us are just like “what the fuck?” but at this point we don’t know what to say to him, and just help him move them into the attic. As we’re moving the stuff up there, I notice that they’re all “middle aged woman fiction” at best and “blatant erotic novel” at worst. I didn’t even know there were that many books out there about this stuff.

Since then he hasn’t made any mention of the books, and I’m sure he has no plan to ever read them. My dad is legitimately worried that the weight of the books are going to damage the rafters of the house. My friend is going to be in town this month, so I’m going to tell him to find something to do with the books or I’m going to donate them all.

Violently decluttered my entire life,"After not liking university in my hometown and not really having an idea of what to do, me and my mum decided that we'd pack up everything (in Canada) and move over to Europe. We'd keep some clothes, keepsakes, things that were irreplaceable, etc, and sell/give away everything else. Doesn't sound too hard, right? Wrong!

We used to live abroad, and when we moved to Canada, instead of getting rid of stuff like any sane person would do, my family shipped over 120 boxes full of stuff! I don't even want to think about how much that must have cost them. Then we lived in a bigger house a few years ago, and bought furniture to fill it out. Furniture that we never really got rid of and just ended up cramming into our little townhouse. The garage was packed, literally to the ceiling, and every cupboard was full in some way. 

We started preparing to move way too damn late, like just over a month before we were set to leave (we had our tickets and had canceled our lease, so there was no going back). We sold lots of stuff on VarageSale (holy shit, I fucking hate some people. Actually, I hate most people on those websites, but that's a different story.) and things sold decently fast, but we were getting to the one week mark and still had a ton of stuff left.

One of the big contributors to the mess was the fact that me and my mum had been (I'll say it in the past-tense in the hope that I'm largely done with it) big thrift store shoppers. We had tons of stuff, and worst of all, tons of stuff that we really loved, so it was pretty impossible to do that ""sparks joy"" stuff when I honestly loved most of it. In the end, we got rid of the clothes we didn't like (and honestly, some stuff that we did like, but was just too damn bulky to store) and vacuum packed the rest to put into storage. I'll always have a lot of clothes, and that's alright, but I'm going to be careful not to accumulate as many as this again. 

We also had a ton of Fisher Price toys from when was brother was little (he's almost 30) that we held onto because we thought that it was worth something. Well, it (surprisingly) is, but we just don't have the time or energy to sort it into sets and sell it. We ended up having a local toystore come and pick it up. 

On the second-to-last day, we somehow still had stuff left. We were cleaning until 10:00PM the night before our flights on Sunday. The amount of stuff that we had was, frankly, ridiculous. All of our old toys, LOADS of clothes, all the kitchen stuff (which was definitely in excess), and basically everything that we've hoarded for 25 years is now gone. 

It's a really weird feeling, and I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't fairly upsetting at times. I know it's necessary to be ruthless, but it's so easy to become attached to things, either through sentimentality or sunk cost fallacy. 

Now we have some boxes in storage, boxes at my brother's place (my poor brother, love him for putting up with our shit), and the suitcases that we brought with us. And that's it. Fixtures of my old life are gone, and now it actually feels pretty good.

Thoughts on hiring an organizer to help declutter?,"My situation is a bit unique, and I’m struggling to declutter. I’m a single mom of 2, I’ve been dealing with chronic headaches for about 6 months and I’ve recently gone back to work part time. I also have depression and bipolar... Work and dealing with the headaches just completely wipes me out. 

I know not everyone has the ability to hire an organizer, and I know everyone is struggling with this process... I’m not sure yet I can afford an organizer but I spoke to one yesterday on the phone and she seemed very down to earth, and very professional. So I decided to get a consult and see where that would go. 

In the past I’ve been able to declutter bits and pieces of my house, and I’ve made progress but the clutter just comes back and I can’t keep up with it. School papers, odds and ends, you name it. I’m struggling with the daily stuff like laundry, dishes and cleaning. 

I don’t have any social support, or friends who’d be able to help. Any thoughts from someone whose gotten an organizer, or just an outsider looking in?

Work and dealing with the headaches just completely wipes me out. 

I know not everyone has the ability to hire an organizer, and I know everyone is struggling with this process... I’m not sure yet I can afford an organizer but I spoke to one yesterday on the phone and she seemed very down to earth, and very professional. So I decided to get a consult and see where that would go. 

In the past I’ve been able to declutter bits and pieces of my house, and I’ve made progress but the clutter just comes back and I can’t keep up with it. School papers, odds and ends, you name it. I’m struggling with the daily stuff like laundry, dishes and cleaning. 

I don’t have any social support, or friends who’d be able to help. Any thoughts from someone whose gotten an organizer, or just an outsider looking in? ",0

Is your wardrobe messing with your emotions?,"Really great article on the attachment to clothing and how to boost your ""wardrobe wellness"".

From the article:

"" We keep things because we feel guilty for not wearing them enough, or because we feel ashamed that our bodies have changed. We keep things because they remind us of our parents, or our friends, or our former selves before a life-changing event like having children, or being ill.

""It's called **essentialism**,"" explains Professor Carolyn Mair, cognitive psychologist and author of The Psychology of Fashion. ""It's the idea that the essence of an object is no longer about its physical properties or function, *it's about associations*. ""

...

"" The key, according to experts, is to learn how to separate clothes from the things you think they represent.

""You need to live in the present, not the past or the future,"" says Annmarie O'Connor. ""Things that symbolise the past are preventing you from engaging with the present.  ""

How much does a carrier bag full of clothes weigh?,"I've been on a decluttering journey and have been tracking how many carrier bags' worth of things I've let go. (The type you would get given if you bought clothes on the high street.)

The weight part has added significance to me as one of my goals is to be less tied to any one location.

Has decluttering/Konmari sparked an intense need to clean/keep your home clean for anyone else?,"So I went through the big initial declutter phase last month.  I tackled it \*aggressively\*.  I have always been like that, when I have a goal, its all I can think about.  With a combo of a 4 day weekend + no kids + semi smallish house(1500 sq feet), was able to get it most of it done in about 4 days(like 8-12 hour days), and then finished the following weekend. 

After everything was decluttered I just basked in this neat space.  I realized that I really enjoyed the look of my counters and rooms with mostly clear surfaces, except for a few carefully picked decorations.  However...  for some reason, I was suddenly able to see how \*dirty\* my house was.  Not like filthy, dirty-dirty, but like grimy corners in the laundry room, dusty baseboards, dirty ceiling fans, scuffs on the wall, husband-made splatters in random places in the kitchen. The house felt better, so now I wanted it to be clean also.  Thus started my new obsession with youtubers and cleaning motivation videos and endless organization sites and videos and downloading cleaning apps on my phone.

So for the past four weeks, I have been endlessly cleaning this house!    I use a phone app(Clean My House, on Android) to track everything for me, like how often my cleaning tasks should be done.  I've been cleaning stuff I had never thought to do before, like pulling out all the kitchen and laundry appliances and cleaning behind and under them, vacuuming refridgerator coils, cleaning out drains.  My house is seriously cleaner than it has ever been--and I am happy!  I feel like as a 34 year old, I am becoming more like the person I want to be.  I \*enjoy\* the clean spaces.  I actually enjoy the cleaning tasks--they are so much easier and quicker when cleaned regularly instead of when they are gross!  Am I the only one like this?

Has anyone found success in a new career after decluttering?,"I've recently decluttered my clothes and books using Marie Kondo's method and found it really helpful in making me feel calmer, more positive and hopeful.

Arachnophobia + Task of Decluttering Basement... Help!?,"Firstly, I've been diagnosed with arachnophobia, so it's very anxiety provoking for me. Unfortunately my dad passed away last year and he a shit ton of belongings in the basement of the home. The landlord says I need to get rid of most of it, but I have a fear of spiders. My basement has quite a few of them, including large ones, like most basements do. I don't have any friends who will clean it for me, it's a TON of stuff, and unfortunately my siblings just ignore my pleas to get help with it.   


What options out there exist that can help me with that? Even if I need to pay. I know there are junkers, but in the middle of all that junk are old family photos and sentimental items that would kill me to throw away.

If you've gone through the process (ideally at least a year ago) and are interested in being considered for my story, please fill out this survey. And please feel free to share! There's a contact email within the survey instructions if you have any questions.

I feel like I'm living in my sister's storage facility,"I rent my dad's house now that he moved in with his girlfriend and my sister is in her late 20s and lives with her husband She left a lot of stuff here and expects me to store it even though I'm paying to rent this house.

Camping and ski equipment, gym machines, childhood stuff like trophies and collections, lots of boxes of clothes, computer parts, etc. I can't have a dining room table or even a desk in what is supposed to be the office because there is barely enough space to walk around. She moved into a small house and they have nowhere to store anything. She thinks she's entitled to keep the stuff here because I live alone and don't need the space.

"If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.","This got longer than expected so TL;DR: Constantly acquiring clothing, 


I’m a clothing hoarder. 


I have plenty of clothing, but for all of my adult years, for any occasion that comes up, I suddenly “have nothing to wear and I have to go find an outfit.” 

This usually results in buying not just an outfit, but also a backup outfit, shoes, something (or some things) from the clearance rack, at least two T-shirts... it’s ridiculous ya’ll. 

I once took a one week vacation to The City of Angels and bought a whole new wardrobe for the occasion. Only to buy ***MORE*** things to wear while there and not wearing anything I brought originally. 


I always browse the clothing sections in ANY store I go into and probably will end up walking away with something I didn’t know I needed, but “I need this for ~~random occasion/activity~~ *lie I’m telling myself to justify buying it*”   Don’t set me loose in a thrift shop either, it gets ugly when there’s a good selection on the racks. And yes, I will definitely look through whatever you’re giving away to see if there’s something I’d like. 


Sure, I’ve culled my collection multiple times and used multiple methods to rid myself of unnecessary clothing. But there’s always been things I justify keeping for one reason or another. None of those reasons being  “I actually wear this”.  Half of what I declutter ends up back in my closet.  I’ve never felt like I’ve fully curated my wardrobe. 

Needless to say, this has led to me having a surplus of clothing and being overwhelmed by the clutter, annoyed at the wasted money/space and unmotivated to declutter because it didn’t work the last time. 

I’ve always been this way and as I’ve gotten older, I’ve really tried to break this unsavory habit of mine. I’ve always failed miserably. 


**This week, something changed in my brain. 


I finally went through ALL of my clothes. Every. Single. Item.  Even the two giant tubs of clothes that haven’t been unpacked through two moves. 

A lot of my justifications in keeping things I had no business keeping were: 

* Too small but *what if*
* Never worn but swore I would 
* Worn it once and never again but *memories*
* Saving it to sell/give away/refashion/whatever


Something just clicked in my head this week and over two days, all those justifications for **keeping** things became the justifications for **decluttering** things.  I was ruthless with my clothing. 

I started by pulling out what I knew I just absolutely won’t wear and what’s falling apart from all the categories. This is usually where I got stuck in the process over the past year or so.  

NOT THIS TIME. I then went section by section, tops, bottoms, dresses, etc and did a quick Yes, No, Maybe sort through. I then tried on each Maybe item and was pleasantly surprised how quickly most turned into No’s simply because they don’t fit.  *Apparently I should have been trying things on this whole time.* This was the catalyst for me to stay strong through the finish. 


I threw out things that were WAYYY past their time, stuffed 3 giant bags full of things to donate and kept only one smallish tub of things in good enough condition to sell.  

The items I’ve kept are all neatly hung and folded. They actually fit into their assigned seats and *surprised Pikachu* I can find something to wear I actually feel good in! It’s also been much easier to walk away, rather than buy more clothing lately. 


What I’ve taken away from this decluttering miracle is number one: don’t be discouraged because your first attempt wasn’t Pinterest perfect. Keep trying until you find your sweet spot and what works for you. Decluttering isn’t always easy, but it sure feels good once it’s done.  

Next up is my makeup collection. I’m not promising anything, but I hope to keep this mindset up. This sub has been a great wealth of motivation. Ya’ll are awesome.

Decide what to keep and what to discard with this Decluttering questionnaire (free pdf),"Here's the text from the [original article on optrimatron.ca](https://www.optimatron.ca/blog/2019/3/17/decide-what-to-keep-and-what-to-discard-with-this-decluttering-questionnaire) (my own website):

**Decide what to keep and what to discard with this Decluttering questionnaire**


Decluttering can be overwhelming. Whether you’re taking on a big spring-cleaning effort to get rid of as much stuff as possible or making a decision about a single item, it can be hard to let physical objects go. It can also be hard to deal with the effects of deciding to keep an object that we previously considered tossing out: the space it occupies, the ongoing frustration of not using it despite our good intentions, maintenance costs, emotions and memories tied to the item, etc. 


In an effort to help clarify your thoughts about the objects you own and arrive at clear decisions about whether or not to keep them, I created a free downloadable pdf guide called the “Decluttering Questionnaire”. The guide asks you to keep in mind a specific item you own and then consider if you agree or disagree with 23 statements. The questionnaire does not arrive at a decision for you; it is meant to help you guide your thinking based on how the item is perceived overall (if you disagree on nearly all statements, you should probably discard it) and how it might be perceived in a new light through certain key statements (your position on one or a few key statements may be enough to guide your decision).


The questionnaire is available for free as a downloadable pdf document on our [Products page](https://www.optimatron.ca/products). You can print it and fill it out by hand or fill it out directly as a pdf document on your device; it has space to type in the name of the item you’re considering and clickable checkboxes (Agree/Disagree) for each statement. It is available in both [English](https://www.optimatron.ca/products) and [French](https://www.optimatron.ca/produits). 


Please [contact us](https://www.optimatron.ca/contact) if you have any ideas to help us improve the questionnaire.

My live in GF has been dealing with debilitating depression the past 6 years due to the loss of both her parents tragically. Our apartment has become completely destroyed.,"She lost his mother to breathe cancer and her father to a tragically answer within 3 years of each other.  She inherited a fair amount of money and also a business.  She hasn't been back to work in 6 years.  She worked for the family business.

So now her answer years ago was to put everything in bins.  There's bins everywhere.  Probably 8 in our bedroom and 15 in our DR/LR and probably another 10-15 randomly across the house.  I don't even think the clothes that are inside the bins are sorted in anyway and so many still have tags.  It's a mess.  I'm anally a neat freak, a grew up with my mom being a pack rat so I've come out the complete opposite.  I've tried time and time again to help my GF to tackle this problem.  Our apartment is becoming an absolute mess.  It's overcrowded and we have a 90# dog and w cats on top of it, were literally running out of room.  I can't walk through our house without getting tripped up on something.  She likes to talk about doing it and organizing and cleaning, but it just never happens.  Can anyone recommend a plan of attack here please? ",0
Some thoughts on the results of decluttering,"You all work so hard at decluttering, and sharing your experiences has helped me tremendously, so I wanted  to share some thoughts on the benefits, just in case you’re feeling discouraged. 
  We’ve been in our home for twenty years and accumulated the usual amount. But after helping empty deceased relatives’ homes and helping a hoarder friend move a few times, and we began to realize we didn’t want all this unused stuff even if we do have space for it, so got rid of a lot. By far the toughest things to deal with have been the things we value that need money sunk into repairs or repurposing, and DIY/craft projects abandoned in various stages of completion. 
   So one Christmas, instead of buying each other gifts, we got things repaired, wrapped them up and put them under the tree. For example, I “received” a diamond ring and he “received” a working vintage radio. It was the same zing as getting a new gift, maybe even better! 
   Next was tackling the unfinished projects. We got ‘em all out, as per Marie Kondo, then started with the easiest and quickest. Honestly, just getting that ball rolling made all the difference. The results are not just less clutter, but also unblocked creativity, more confidence and improved skills, and some pretty cool stuff. We’ve found things we’d forgotten about that we really liked, and put them to use or on display. Gifts are finished, given and being enjoyed. Artwork that sat in closets for decades is now matted, framed, and hanging where we can enjoy it, and that’s been like receiving the perfect gifts. Our home is now looking like we once imagined it. We’re still working on it, but all in all, it feels really good.

Four Months Ahead,"I currently live in a compact 700 sq ft 1-bedroom apartment with my boyfriend. It's actually his place and I recently moved back in 2 weeks ago after having moved last year.

Moving out of the house because of excess clutter.,"*Apologies, slightly long read.

We have a small house with bedrooms of 11x11 feet. My parents have ran out of space in the living room and their bedroom so they chuck their collective things in my bedroom. I only have 2 boxes and 2 drawers of stuff in there but over the years, they have stored 8 boxes (2x4 ft) worth of stuff!

I've done my part in throwing out my old things which significantly cleared some space but I just cannot ""organize"" anymore because there is simply no more space. I've been trying to convince them of throwing/donating their stuff (mostly outdated magazines, outgrown clothes, ripped bags). It feels like not my room anymore and it is very ""suffocating"" already considering how small the room is to begin with.

Need help organizing baby clothes,"I bought [this canvas wardrobe](https://imgur.com/a/wdPKzqa) , 6 storage boxes, and small chest if drawers and a plastuc 4 tub storage unit to store all my babies clothes but don't know how to get started and am overwhelmed by the amount, any help please??

It has 2 hanging racks, 6 cubes in which I have placed boxes and at the bottom of the hanging racks, a flat space which looks useful for blankets and sheets?

My child is in 3 sizes of clothes currently due to me using reusable diapers which cause a very large butt and need bigger sizes and also using disposables which need the smaller sizes. I'm not sure how to sort them due to the variety of clothes as well - sleepsuits, bodysuits, baby grows, pants/trousers, t shirts, hoodies, coats, pram suits etc. If I sort via size then the categories mix, but if I sort by category then it's harder to find the right size depending on what diaper he has. I don't have much hanging space so most will be in the boxes so how would I sort by size if each box is a different type of clothing? I could learn each piece but that's a large feat. I would prefer to have his sleepsuits/all in ones hung as he uses them most but not sure if it makes more sense to hang other things?

Currently all but his normal current size with the small diapers are stored in plastic boxes under my bed but I need them easily accessible now. 

All his soft toys, misc soft things and muslins/clothes and mittens are currently in a canvas shoe holder on the back of his door which is great. His socks, bibs and hats are in those drawer organisers in his very small 3 drawer chest of drawers with towels and baby sleeping bags on the bottom, pram suits/fluffies on the second and drawer organiser on the top. I also have an above waist high 4 drawer plastic storage unit which I can use but it currently empty.

If anyone can offer any suggestions I will be amazingly grateful as I'm not naturally this organised but I do enjoy my house tidy with everything in it's place and the baby clothes have defeated me with the sheer number of his clothes (especially as they were all given to me so I don't know all the clothes and didn't choose them so I can't just look at them and know the size or fit etc).

I just sorted out more than half my wardrobe!,"*Man*, it feels good. [This is the giant pile](https://i.imgur.com/Dga8NFV.jpg?1) of things that are going. I can't even believe it - I have clothes in there that I don't even remember seeing. Ever.

It still needs to be properly sorted through - can donation places accept clothes that are not in great condition, or is it entirely useless for them? I own a large parrot, so a number of shirts in there have lots of small holes in the shoulders, from her claws.

There were a lot of items that I had worn less than 5 times, too. Maybe I can point this out to my family, and they will stop bringing me clothes just because they're my size. (I can wish!)

Massive Haul of CDs from my collector dad--what to do?,"My dad was a serious music collector and this library was his life's work in a lot of ways.  It's hard for us to let it go, but we don't listen to much of the music on the CDs themselves and right now we are paying almost $200 a month to store them in a temperature-controlled environment.

His collection is a mix of regular/probably worthless discs, and maybe some valuable ones.  He used to joke that this collection was our inheritance.  What an ironic twist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice for what we should do?  There are probably 200 boxed sets, some opened, some not, that I am guessing will garner the most $$ (if at all...again, I don't have much knowledge on their value), but then there are the 4000+ other CDs.  It breaks my heart to think of them in the trash, so any and all suggestions are appreciated and welcome. I can send pics in PM of the box sets I have so far.

A long overdue decluttering,"In an effort to simplify and purge all the unnecessary meaningless ""things"", I have been working my way through the various rooms and areas of my housing decluttering anything I can get my hands on. One of the last areas I have to work on is: The Basement.

When we moved in nearly 3 years ago our basement became a dumping ground for anything we didn't have a place for or didn't want to deal with right away. The problem has been mostly out of sight out of mind as we don't use the basement for much (aside from junk storage). So now, I've been going through and finding homes for things that I could and filtering out the rest. 

I've made a lot of progress but 2 big problem areas remain: 

1) Kid's toys. We have a ton downstairs that are literally never played with because they have an entire toy room upstairs filled with toys. Plus, the kids don't go in the basement and have probably forgotten that these toys even exist. 

2) Old video games/electronics. Piles of unused old games and consoles, controllers, empty console boxes(why?). These are my husband's and have not been touched since we moved in other than being shifted around and consolidated in one area.

I've been asking my husband to help me go through some of the remaining stuff for a while, but he's been less than enthusiastic. Last week he agreed that if I took care of it myself I would be free to make whatever decisions I wanted. This surprised me because he can be hesitant to let things go, but I decided not to question it too much as I was afraid he would change his mind. Today, having a empty house and some time I decided to get as much done as I could.

I ended up with 5 regular + 1 big black garbage bag of toys and 2 regular + 1 black garbage bag of video game stuff. 

[Results](https://imgur.com/a/6oIEU8c)

This is the part I feel a little bad about:

I took the bags and put them straight in the bin and put it down by the road. I just watched the garbage truck pick them up and roll away. I know not all of it was strictly garbage, but I know that if the stuff didn't leave the house immediately some of it was bound to make its way back out of the bags.

So, that's my story. Overall I'm pretty satisfied, but I was wondering if any other people ever trashed something just to get it out of the house.

Slightly different kind of de-cluttering; How about de-cluttering a small business? Scan to excel???,"I have a fujitsu scansnap organizer for my home and have always wondered if my scansnap or any other scanner organizer on the market could scan business reports to excel. I have switched my family business's bookkeeping to excel and now handle it my self. I LOVE EXCEL. I wonder if instead of having to plug numbers from reading paper reports; I could simply scan and organize the reports while at the same time train a software to extract necessary numbers to simply fill in to the right cells and thereby finish my bookkeeping (eventually once i have all kinks worked out) by simply scanning the reports in.

If there was a way to do this the possibilities are endless. It can potentially make inventory control a breeze. No more over ordering because the same item was stored in multiple locations and the person creating the order only recorded a partial inventory level. No more realizing the business is out of stock on an item and having to make emergency purchases at any price. 

I hope someone has an answer for me here because the idea doesn't seem so far fetched. The placement of headings and their corresponding numbers on our reports and the invoices rarely change. I already have a POS system which spits out sales by sku on an excel report .",declutter,1552142271,curious-reader,8,50,True,az43f0,2019-03-09,"Slightly different kind of de-cluttering; How about de-cluttering a small business?

You know you're on the right path when...,"Just wanted to share an amusing thing that happened yesterday while shopping for clothes.

There was a 3 for 2 discount for some tights, but I only needed two pairs. The cashier started telling me about how if I got another pair, I'd get it for free, but I didn't really want another pair.

So I told her ""No, it's okay""

She asked me several times if I understood what she had told me, because *it wasn't logical to pass up on such an opportunity!*

Afterwards, I just thought to myself how this interaction was actually proof that I was doing something right: in the past, purchases like these were the reason my house got so cluttered, i.e., stuff I didn't need but that was on sale or a deal like this one. And yesterday was different. I purchased what I needed, and that was it.

In my opinion, a huge part of decluttering is not only removing things from your space, but also **creating boundaries** in order to avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly.

Creative ideas for lack of closet space?,"I live in a rental house which has exactly small 1 closet in my bedroom and 1 teeny tiny coat closet that has no shelves in the thiving room. Both closets are full of clothes and linens. So I have no place for hobby type things.

"the link between mending and decluttering, and procrastination","I had a pile of mending, hemming of pants, etc. (In the past I've had similar projects--something that needed to be fixed or mailed, etc.--involving some sort of task that needed to be done.)

Decluttering &amp; Rearranging,"I'm just going to get into the meat of my story right now:

I'm a 16 year old female, and I share a room with my 11 year old younger sister. She has a hoarding problem and her side of the room is consistently messy with trash, old dishes, toys, and other small stuff. I can't touch her side of the room, I can only get mine.

The problem: Our room is such a weird shape, and it probably wasn't meant to hold all the furniture we have. In our most recent rearrangement, we got rid of her dresser, which means we now share one and also use the closet. I'll say it now, I can't stand that.

I would love to have my dresser back, but I need an idea for a room arrangement. I can give y'all the imgur links to our room &amp; furniture measurements, as well as pictures of what it looks like right now.


Onto the actual decluttering:

We have too much stuff for one room shared by two people. My stuff is mostly old notebooks, books, school supplies, and just generally old knickknacks. Her stuff is a mixture of everything you can think of. Old hobbies, trash, toys she played with when she was younger, other things...

It gets tiring when I walk into the room and see clothes on the floor (because hanging stuff up is not for me, I do it probably once a week when I get the motivation, otherwise the clothes just sit on the floor. It gets tiring when I walk into the room and all I can see is her junk.

Do y'all have any ideas? I can give you any info you want if you ask the question in your comments. (Just no personal info, though I probably shouldn't have to say that.)

Declutter tips just for you,"  

**Clearing Begets Clarity**

Have you noticed how clearing the spaces around yourself has an immediate and uplifting impact on your emotional and mental states? It is a little harder to feel burdened by “stuff” when you’re actively involved with, or benefitting from it being moved, changed, rearranged, pruned, cleaned, thinned and/or rationalised. 

**Clearing Your Spaces**

Somehow, jumbles of rubble weigh down our souls. They contribute to the illusion that things are impossible to deal with and that it’s just too hard to try. 

📷But, for every little thing that gets sorted, tossed or handed on, surprisingly, you reclaim a little bit more of your own strength and vitality for life. When you’re looking at an overwhelming proposition, the trick is to start with one little step and move forward from there. Once you start clearing, it creates more space, as well as a sense of achievement and progress that can propel you even further forwards.

**Re-organising Your Environments**

They say the people and things in our lives are external representations of our internal patterns and programs; that what we tell ourselves on the ‘inside’ is reflected in what goes on around us. Well, whether that’s exactly true or not, it’s hard to disagree with the idea that [decluttering](http://www.anextrapairofhands.com.au/) and re-organising your spaces will improve your physical environment and, more importantly, your head-space. Organising and streamlining your office, study, rooms, cupboards and so on, creates flow – and, as each space is worked on, *even the flow streamlines itself.* 

**Using Systems as a Tool**

Before you plunge into the big jobs, it is great to have an idea of what systems you will use in your sorting and clearing process. With a plan in place you won’t have to think from scratch every step of the way. Using boxes, bags, or even floor spaces earmarked for washing, storing, throwing out or donating is a great start. 

It's fundamentally important to create categories. They are essential to any successful 'Decluttering’ or ‘Reorganising’ project. How often have you kept something for years knowing it will come in handy one day, but then you don’t know where to find it when you need it and end up buying a new one? Grouping items in easily accessible and clearly labelled containers is a great way to always know where to lay your hand on what you need. Creating and fine-tuning systems is a marvellous and highly important tool for every 'Organising Project', and gives you a real sense of power over your surroundings.

**Committing to the Experience**

Embarking on an ‘Organising’ or ‘Decluttering’ project can really be a fun experience. You can feel there’s progress at every turn, plus it strengthens your ability to handle and even enjoy your immediate environment. The more committed you are to seeing a project through to completion, the better and more wonderful the results will be - both in your physical and mental world. 

**When in Doubt, Delegate!**

If you feel lacking in drive or energy to make a start, then don’t let that stop you! Seeking assistance is one of the most positive steps you can take. Decluttering achieves far more than worry and overwhelm can ever do. Enlisting help is a system in itself, and will definitely ensure progress. There is no shame in delegating to a good professional who can really help in a positive and non-judgemental way. Their role is simply to make your project an enjoyable and fun experience and to help you achieve your goal. 

So, what’s stopping you?

"Reluctantly parted with my piano, and it was great!","**tl;dr:** When you're thinking about those prize possessions, ask yourself if you're really using them, and if someone else will get more enjoyment out of it than you will.

OK, long time lurker, first time poster.  This was a big one.  I've had an old upright piano that's been in the family for at least thirty years.  I was sentimentally attached to it, having grown up with it, but I rarely played it because I prefer my guitar.  So, I put it on CraigsList, and constantly thought about taking the ad down.  It's a big, beautiful, 100-year-old instrument.  How can I part with such a wonderful thing?

This weekend I reluctantly showed the piano to a potential buyer.  He ended up staying and playing it for almost an hour and was super nice.  When he came over with the movers, he told me he was so excited about the piano that he barely slept the night before.  He was so happy that it melted away my attachment to the piano—it was going to an owner who really loved it and was actually going to use it.

As I continue on my long-term declutter project, here are some things I've learned:

* **Rules help:** My main tool is that if I haven't used it in over five years, I need to *seriously* consider selling/donating it.  If I haven't used it, I probably won't in the future, and someone else can get more enjoyment from it than me.  I don't get rid of everything I haven't used, but it works great for cleaning out closets and garages.  I struggled with the ""does it spark joy"" rule, because I can't really measure joy, and I often couldn't separate ""joy"" from ""sentimentality"", but that is another good way to do it if it works for you.
* **Keep a list:** For things I'm unsure/sentimental about selling, I keep a list of them.  This has helped me keep my thoughts organized, but also I've found that it detaches the emotion from the object over time.  I can look at my to-sell list and pick the item I'm least attached to, and the longer it's been on the list, the easier I've found it to part with it because I've accepted it.  It also feels great to cross things off the list once they're gone!
* **Make it a habit:** Every day, I try to do a little decluttering: sort something into the donate bin, take photos for a for-sale listing, write a new for-sale listing (eBay/Craigslist/etc.), or pack/ship/deliver something that has already sold.  If I don't know what to do, I look at my list for ideas.  This keeps the work manageable to 15-30 minutes a day so I don't burn out, and also makes the decluttering a regular habit instead of a one-and-done purge.  My concern is that if I purge, I will end up right where I was before, just like a fad diet.  I've also made a decent amount of money selling stuff piece by piece rather than throwing/giving it away in a purge.
* **Just say No:** One of my challenges was saying ""No"" to family and friends who want to give me their unwanted stuff.  I have a ton of furniture and decorative items that I accepted because of sentimental reasons or because it was free and I couldn't resist the bargain.  But at the end of the day, the people and the photos and the memories are what matter, and most (not all) of the stuff is really just ""stuff"".
* **Avoid relapse:** I've learned to avoid thrift stores and garage sales like the plague, because I almost always come home with clutter that I don't need.  Before bringing home a new thing, I ask myself: Will I still want this tomorrow? Where am I going to put it? How often will I actually use this? Can I wait until tomorrow to think about it?  This has saved me from a lot of impulse buys.

&amp;#x200B;",declutter,1552504574,GenericStatement,22,141,True,b0q09v,2019-03-13,"Reluctantly parted with my piano, and it was great! **tl;dr:** When you're thinking about those prize possessions, ask yourself if you're really using them, and if someone else will get more enjoyment out of it than you will.

OK, long time lurker, first time poster.  This was a big one.  I've had an old upright piano that's been in the family for at least thirty years.  I was sentimentally attached to it, having grown up with it, but I rarely played it because I prefer my guitar.  So, I put it on CraigsList, and constantly thought about taking the ad down.  It's a big, beautiful, 100-year-old instrument.  How can I part with such a wonderful thing?

This weekend I reluctantly showed the piano to a potential buyer.  He ended up staying and playing it for almost an hour and was super nice.  When he came over with the movers, he told me he was so excited about the piano that he barely slept the night before.  He was so happy that it melted away my attachment to the piano—it was going to an owner who really loved it and was actually going to use it.

As I continue on my long-term declutter project, here are some things I've learned:

* **Rules help:** My main tool is that if I haven't used it in over five years, I need to *seriously* consider selling/donating it.  If I haven't used it, I probably won't in the future, and someone else can get more enjoyment from it than me.  I don't get rid of everything I haven't used, but it works great for cleaning out closets and garages.  I struggled with the ""does it spark joy"" rule, because I can't really measure joy, and I often couldn't separate ""joy"" from ""sentimentality"", but that is another good way to do it if it works for you.

"Books, Foreign Coins, and Magazines","I'm looking for ideas to try and declutter, and these are my top 3 issues. I just heard of the bookscouter app, so I will take a look at that.

Help me organise my room storage?," Hi so


I think only reddit can help. I have a room full of stuff. So much stuff. I have no idea how to utilise my storage and where to put everything. I have a bedside locker that has a big square cabinate space and I'm not sure what to put in there ?(so far in the top section i have books. A pen holder and notebooks. 


In the cabinate part under I have my hair dryer. Hair Straightener. Pain killers.  Headphones.  Eye mask.  Has room for more.

I have an mirror vanity table. 

A computer desk.  

One chest of drawers. 

One long wardrobe. 

A double bed( under the bed is so dusty and I have one or two boxes of stuff I need to throw out. Maybe my plastic boxes can be utilised under since they have lids.?) 

2 small wall shelves( i usually have dvds and albums there but I am thinking of selling or donating my dvds as I never ever watch them). 

My bedside table has a bunch of figurines on top and thinking of putting them on one of the wall shelves and make my bedside table topvarea less cluttered with a lamp candle and coaster only. Maybe a plant. 

What can I put at the top section of a sectioned wardrobe? I dont own many handbags or shoes. I mostly have decorations. Gadgets. Just stuff. Lots of stuff.  Lots of clothes.  I'm too lazy fold clothes lol so bare that in mind. 

I have 2 small wicker storage boxes full of oddities I need to sort and  lots of huge plastic storage boxes. In one of thosea I have all my wires and older consoles / handdhelds.  In the rest is some clothes. All my  other clothes ive put in black sacks for sorting back into my drawersans wardrobes (any organise tips for that too?).

I use a flat screen Tv its on my chest ot drawers which has my ps3 aand switch attached.


I'm sorry this is a lot of info to process but hope that is enough. Maybe ill need to invest in a better storage unit/wardrobe. 

This all started because I am moving for a while to my dade place and wabtrdwanted to rid of stuff so its tidy for guests or myself when i come back to stay. 

I'm a bit of a hoarder...thanks !

Finally in a fully clean and decluttered living space!,"My boyfriend and I were living in such a cluttered apartment that it was driving me nuts. I moved in 3 months ago, he’s not the tidiest but I knew that from that start so I was prepared for a ride. I’m a clean person, he just had so much stuff everywhere that it was overwhelming. It didn’t help when I had moving boxes everywhere after I first moved in, it was so bad we had to legit climb/ step over things just to do basic daily tasks. 

We finally unboxed things, scrubbed the place down and decluttered a couple weeks ago and now we have a really nice, clean and liveable space. Before I moved in, I was really into cleaning but I was in a bit of a funk afterwards because there was just SO much to do that it was intimidating. Now I just look forward to the basic every day cleaning tasks again which is relieving; nothing is better than waking up to a clean home and that’s what motivates me, apart from the fact I genuinely do enjoy it. 

My advice to anyone who is intimidated by their clutter and mess, honestly you need to just bite the bullet. It might take all day or a couple days but holy hell is it rewarding. Cleaning after the initial big clean is a lot easier and not difficult to maintain at all because it’s just a little bit every day and not just one massive cleaning session every once in a while. It’ll help you from disliking cleaning and might even encourage you to maintain your clean home easier.

How do you handle duplicates you'll actually use in the future?,"I’ve been purging things a lot lately, but I’m feeling like I’m not getting rid of very much because a lot of my clutter is stuff that I \*will\* use in the future. 

For example, I have tons of extra cords/chargers/converters. I don’t need all of them now, but when one goes out, I reach into that (very large) drawer. Assuming they’re working, it’s hard to justify throwing them out.

I’ve made a conscious effort to make sure that I don’t buy anything without triple checking that I don’t have a backup already, but sometimes: a) I’m sure I’m out of something and then later I find one, b) I don’t have access to those backups (e.g., charger breaks while traveling), c)  I'm given something I already have.

 So it feels like the pile never really decreases. 

Same thing with beauty stuff. Because of my job, I receive a lot of sort of free ""fun"" beauty products, like face masks and bath bombs. No one needs 10 face masks, but I will use all 10 *eventually* so throwing them away to make room in a drawer seems wasteful.

I travel a lot, and I think that’s a major contributing factor. I literally have four hairdryers, all for different outlets. Not to mention all of the mini-toiletries that I will get through eventually.

It's easy for me to throw away things that I can't actually see myself using, but it's hard to throw out perfectly usable things that I genuinely will use.",declutter,1550786363,NeverRainingRoses,12,13,True,at92z5,2019-02-21,"How do you handle duplicates you'll actually use in the future?

Pseudo Progress vs. Actual Progress,"Awoke I posted about the lack of donation bags in my home. Boy, how wrong I was! I borrowed my roommmates ""More of Less"" book and had to face some hard truth--- I put VERY little work in making actual progress. I've been letting just as much stuff into my home and justified it by ""getting rid of 1 thing a day"" and cheating it because I included food stuffs. I call that ""pseudo progress"".


After reading that book, it hit me that I MUST do better. And that I won't see progress until I strip things way way *way* down and appreciate my very favorite things. 


One user pointed out that with the lack of donation bags, my home is more efficient. Sadly, I do not feel at that point yet.


My remedy is to listen to minimalist podcasts for inspo, hang out here longer and most importanly, WALK instead of driving to the donation drop off. I want the physical relief of not carrying that clutter around anymore.

I can’t believe it. I’ve actually made progress.,"About a year ago, my fiancé was about to tear her hair out over the clutter and it woke me up. My house wasn’t super tidy growing up, but it was never disgusting- but now my parents totally live in a disgusting hoarder house, and it terrified me to think I could be headed the same way. 

So a year ago I started doing everything I could, and I’ve been working on it since. I’ve been downsizing everything from clothing to art supplies to furniture. I bought dozens of stackable clear plastic shoeboxes and organized my art studio top to bottom. I’ve been sharply inventorying everything I own.

This has been a gradual thing, done in bits and pieces. There is still lots to be done, but this morning I realized looking around, so much progress has happened because I stuck to it and set reasonable, tangible goals, and criteria for the things I wanted to keep. 


My personal goals/ground rules that I’ve tried to stick to-

- no more stuff hidden behind/under things. The clear shoeboxes have been super helpful for that, especially in the art studio. This is especially important because my fiancé is visually impaired, too much clutter makes her life damn near impossible.

- donate, gift, or use art supplies before they go bad, and purge anything that doesn’t work anymore. 

- if I’m holding onto something for “projects” (like an old sheet, for example), then I have to actually do it, and have a spot for it. Even better if it’s something I can reduce the size of and organize better (ripping the sheets and rolling them into balls).

- organizing like with like, keeping things collected and in the place most suitable for it. Sprawling dresser and shelves covered in various personal care products? Now it’s a single open-top bucket with everything in it, next to the bed where we get ready in the morning. 

I still have a long way to go, especially as far as routines go, but a year ago I couldn’t see the floor of my bedroom or my studio and I couldn’t find anything I needed, ever. Now, it’s so much easier to find what I need, and to clean up when there’s a place to put things away!

Moving across the country. Best way to get rid of things?,"I have a large bedroom worth of stuff, plus two closets. The move will be taking place in three months and I'll only be taking what fits in my car. So for now, I've tried to sell some stuff like cups ($5), a mirror ($15), a comforter ($20), storage trunk ($25), etc. I live in a major city and I've listed them on Facebook Marketplace and Offerup with nice pictures. However, I've received NO messages except for the trunk. For that one, I've received literally 30 people asking if it's available and then nothing else. 

Another strategy that I'm thinking of is that when I finally do sell the furniture, I can ask people if they want anything else. I'm also thinking of posting a picture of my entire room online and asking people what they want and to throw in an offer. 

Besides that, I'm not really sure what to do and I'm looking for suggestions. What kind of prices do you recommend for items like that? Is having a yard sale worth it? Should I donate it all?

This is too much,"I apologize if this isnt the right place for this post, please let me know where to post this if this isnt the right place

So when I lived alone, my worst problem was just not putting stuff away. Basically it never got unhygenic, I was just messy. 

Now I have been living with my boyfriend and its really bad. Theres dishes and silverware that hasnt been washed in weeks, old foam to go containers, clothes everywhere, and ect. I was raised to wash dishes RIGHT after you finish using them, and never leave trash on the floor.

So the situation i am living in is just way too much for me. I literally cant bring myself to even begin cleaning bc I did not create this mess, when i do start i feel sick, and even if I was to finish it just makes me mad that its going to just get like this anyways in a few days. 

Hell I even tried to make him clean it because i thought if he did the work it would motivate him to not get it to be messy again bc of how hard he worked to get it clean. Didnt work out bc you know, its literally back to the way it was before he cleaned. It takes so long to find stuff in this room and i thought that would also encourage him to keep it clean but nope. 

I have no idea how to start on getting this room together and making sure it NEVER goes back to being so unhygenically messy.

Combining lives without combining clutter?,"Hi! I just stumbled on this subreddit today, so please let me know if there's an older post that covers this topic. I looked but didn't find anything recent.

I recently got engaged, and my fiancé and I will be looking for a house later this year and moving in together. I couldn't be happier, but I know it will be quite the process for both of us to move at the same time, into the same place. I'm also worried that together we'll have a lot of stuff.

Over the past month, I konmari'd my clothes, miscellaneous items, and paperwork.

I guess I'm mostly asking for advice from other community members who've moved in with someone, and how I can help to make sure both of us are ready to move in together, and how we can keep ourselves from accidentally getting over-eager about the new house and filling it with stuff we don't need.",declutter,1551048438,TheAllMightiest,30,79,True,audnqk,2019-02-24,"Combining lives without combining clutter?

Decluttering at last minute due to moving house short notice.,"TLDR: moving house at short notice with no time to fully declutter and clear up as we go. Looking for advice to make it easier.


Moving house last minute to a place I want to be less cluttered. I’ll be the first to admit that our old place was never the way we wanted it, cluttered and a small place, never dirty but always looked messy, and due to my OCD I hold onto things I don’t need! This has left us with a huge amount of work to do with no time to go through absolutely everything. So due to time constraints we’re shifting a lot of stuff we don’t need to the new place which needs sorted, which I really didn’t want to do, if we had the chance I rather have decluttered BEFORE taking it in.

I am absolutely determined I want to turn over a new leaf and for our new place to be as minimal as possible, a fresh start, which I understand involves being completely ruthless. I’m more than prepared to ditch half of my wardrobe as I have an insane amount of clothes etc.

I suppose I’m just looking for some tips, support and advice on how to stay motivated and get it all done in the easiest and quickest way possible?!

Does poverty or past experinces with poverty make one more likely to hoard?,"I’ve been binge reading articles, blogs, forums posts about decluttring, minimalism, and hoarding for the past few weeks.

I lot of the times, I run into examples of how poverty makes one likely to hoard. Specifically examples of people’s ancestors that lives through the great depression hoarding things to an unreasonable degree.

Also, I run into perspectives that shine light on how the ability to minimize, downsize, and declutter require a bit of economic privilege.

Working on decluttering and need a Discord community of support?,"I imagine there could be an influx of people looking to declutter with the start of 2019 (although at this point maybe New Year's resolutions are out the window already?

Either way, I thought I'd drop a reminder that a Discord server (originating from the demand here) exists, and you're welcome to join!

Thinking of holding on to my donate pile for a while,"I usually donate my stuff to a local thrift store that has a mission that directly benefits our community.

I called the store and asked when they thought they would be accepting more and she said it could be ar least 2 months. (Then she asked if I wanted to volunteer and help sort).

Motivation to tidy and declutter a negative space?,"I need your help!

I’m currently living in a really horrible rental with my fiancé. It’s old and feels like every day there’s something new that’s breaking. There’s not a lot of space and it can look quite cluttered and messy very quickly if we don’t try utilise the space. 
This then completely overwhelms me and I find it very hard to navigate the tidying process.
We plan to move in September when our lease is up to somewhere newer and nicer we can settle in to while saving for buying a home.

My issue is that my dislike for this home is giving me a lot of anxiety and is making me lazy because of it.
I usually love organisation and making things look pretty and welcoming but this house completely destroys any motivation I have to tidy.

I will go to organise and declutter, look at the space and think “there is 0 potential, I can’t do anything with this. There’s no where to put stuff, everything is going to look crappy anyway.”

Please send me videos, blogs, ANYTHING to help motivate me.

"Overwhelmed by things, thinking about adopting a daily uniform, in a stalemate with makeup, have a complicated relationship with books, trouble storing art supplies, and more. Advice needed.","I've had an ongoing war with things for the past 7 years of my life, an ongoing cycle of binging and purging as my tastes and interests change. Currently, I'm sitting in the cluttered rubble of the post-holidays war-zone and I've been putting off handling it for too long.

I'm honest just done with having all of this stuff! It feels so heavy and stressful and unnecessary!

I need help with...

Clothes:
• I want to have a daily uniform wardrobe, but my preferred look is mostly black and that really only looks good if it's not covered in pet fur, which is a big issue for me! The majority of my clothes are already black, so I wouldn't have to buy anything new, I just don't know how to get around the pet fur issue without going through tons of lint rollers. 
• Ideally I would have no more clothes than one load of laundry and I could preferably wash them al together. 
• What to do with all these bags, winter items, and accessories I use maybe a handful of times in a year? 

Makeup:
• I don't wear face makeup except on occasion, and even then I don't really like it, however I keep it for those occasions. I only have one of each kind of face product, but it still feels like a lot.
• Eyeshadow palettes were my weakness this Christmas and I'm trying to come to terms with knowing I'll never use it all, but I still can't get past thinking that I need every single shade just in case. 

Books: 
• I don't have a ton of books and they're all stored nicely on shelves, but I can't help but feel my space would open up and be less overwhelming if I could get rid of the shelves. I really love reading paper books though and they do bring me joy. 

Art Supplies:
• I find that I use them more if I have them in a place I can see them regularly, but I don't like the look of having them out. 

Memory/Sentimental Items:
• I won't get rid of these. I'm the kind of person that gets a lot of joy from these as I go through them regularly; so, they aren't just sitting and collecting dust. However, there's a lot of it and my organizing system is very unorganized. 

Miscellaneous: 
• Jesus take the wheel.
• I've consolidated it down to a small bin, but that bin is utter chaos and I never use most of it, but I can't bring myself to get rid of it. 
• I'd say decor falls in this area as well and I have a lot of that... I like it because it keeps the room from feeling too empty, but I also feel like it's so unnecessary. 

TL;DR: In need of super minimal all black wardrobe (with pets) tips, advice on parting with makeup, visible yet out of the way storage ideas for art supplies and books, organization ideas for sentimental items and miscellaneous, and simple yet effective decorative solutions. 

Big question: I usually try to sell things I want to get rid of because it makes me feel like I didn't waste my money, but it always clutters up my limited space while I wait for it to sell. Is it worth it to do that or should I just cut my losses and rehome/donate?

Advice for Addressing Book Clutter?,"I've been doing a lot of decluttering, and have been making pretty good progress. But I've encountered a bit of a block when it comes to my books.

"My cousin and I cleaned and organized her hoarded room. It started out as a nightmare, but she's so happy now!!","[Pics](https://imgur.com/a/tL0BuTR)

She's 13. My family are all hoarders (except me and my brother so far. Hopefully not my cousin.) No one ever taught her to clean or organize. My grandma, bless her angelic soul, is an enabler (disabler) who hates drawers and other conventional storage methods.

She saw how good it could be and how much work it took. 

She has never (never!) had a space of her own that she was in control of. She also has always lived around hoarding. I hope that she will see how good life can be when everything has a place, and I will continue to help her.

There’s just so much I can’t even bring myself to start,"I’m 20 and I’ve been a hoarder pretty much all my life. My mother was never really a hoarder, but she never did anything to stop or help me with it. I had a bedroom and a massive playroom growing up with so many things and odds and ends and I could never ever keep anything remotely clean, and I’d always have trash just thrown about cuz I could never throw anything away for some reason. I never really had friends come over to my house because of the mess, and now that has given me a lot of anxiety about people being in my room, I honestly can’t stand it. The only person I’m comfortable with coming into my space at this point is my boyfriend, and I’m still just embarrassed about everything and would rather we be elsewhere as I’m never really comfortable with it. 
I moved in with my birth mother for a little under a year, but I didn’t take everything with me, and I left my bedroom and the spare room a mess with all of my things saying “I’ll get to it later” (my mom lived pretty close and I came back most weekends and she had knee problems so never went upstairs which probably contributed to everything). When living with my birth mother I was relatively happy with all the things I had. My room was smaller, and I only brought my clothes and a few Knick knacks and other stuff that I needed and it was honestly great. I’ve had a dream of living in a tiny house and those few months really solidified that, and I knew it was something I could do easily. But I knew that I had an entire floor of stuff back home, and I never dealt with it.

I moved back home eight months later and it was a mess, in every sense of the word. There were clothes and garbage and just random things everywhere and you couldn’t see the floor. And I just had to throw the rest of my stuff on top of it. Literally. I put my mattress on top of all of the clutter until I got my bed frame back. 
I cleaned a square of the room for a livable space and I honestly kept it relatively clean for a few months, but there were still parts of the room with just so much mess and the other room was still untouched, but I decided to take up sewing and the desk was under a pile of things and I just shoved them all into the free space so I had a place to put my impulsively bought sewing machine. And then it went back to hell. Garbage on the floor, rotting food hidden under clothes, month old fast food cups leaking and sticking to the furniture, old packaging material and boxes, projects that I gave up on, even sex toys I just left on the bed and pushed off when I went to sleep. It was all just too daunting and embarrassing to ask for help, or start on my own. So I left it. 

Now my mom is planning on selling the house and moving closer to family, so I have to deal with everything.

I’m so tired of all of it and I don’t want it anymore and I just want to throw everything in the garbage, but I have troubles with personification and I can’t imagine just throwing some of these things in the trash. I can’t ask my mom for help because like I said earlier there are some sex toys and various other things that a little old lady doesn’t need to see, and my boyfriend is at college, so I have to do this myself.

I don’t entirely know what this post is at this point. I just need some motivation or advice or anything. I need someone to tell me it’s okay to throw things away. 

Tldr: hoarding my whole life, my mom is moving and I have 4 days to get rid of two rooms full of clutter mixed with garbage.",declutter,1550483617,dumbdinospacebean,14,11,True,arvo6d,2019-02-18,"There’s just so much I can’t even bring myself to start I’m 20 and I’ve been a hoarder pretty much all my life. My mother was never really a hoarder, but she never did anything to stop or help me with it. I had a bedroom and a massive playroom growing up with so many things and odds and ends and I could never ever keep anything remotely clean, and I’d always have trash just thrown about cuz I could never throw anything away for some reason. I never really had friends come over to my house because of the mess, and now that has given me a lot of anxiety about people being in my room, I honestly can’t stand it. The only person I’m comfortable with coming into my space at this point is my boyfriend, and I’m still just embarrassed about everything and would rather we be elsewhere as I’m never really comfortable with it. 
I moved in with my birth mother for a little under a year, but I didn’t take everything with me, and I left my bedroom and the spare room a mess with all of my things saying “I’ll get to it later” (my mom lived pretty close and I came back most weekends and she had knee problems so never went upstairs which probably contributed to everything). When living with my birth mother I was relatively happy with all the things I had. My room was smaller, and I only brought my clothes and a few Knick knacks and other stuff that I needed and it was honestly great. I’ve had a dream of living in a tiny house and those few months really solidified that, and I knew it was something I could do easily. But I knew that I had an entire floor of stuff back home, and I never dealt with it.

I moved back home eight months later and it was a mess, in every sense of the word. There were clothes and garbage and just random things everywhere and you couldn’t see the floor. And I just had to throw the rest of my stuff on top of it. Literally. I put my mattress on top of all of the clutter until I got my bed frame back. 
I cleaned a square of the room for a livable space and I honestly kept it relatively clean for a few months, but there were still parts of the room with just so much mess and the other room was still untouched, but I decided to take up sewing and the desk was under a pile of things and I just shoved them all into the free space so I had a place to put my impulsively bought sewing machine. And then it went back to hell. Garbage on the floor, rotting food hidden under clothes, month old fast food cups leaking and sticking to the furniture, old packaging material and boxes, projects that I gave up on, even sex toys I just left on the bed and pushed off when I went to sleep. It was all just too daunting and embarrassing to ask for help, or start on my own. So I left it.

VHS and Cassette Tapes,"I need ideas for where to get rid of, sell, donate, or recycle VHS and cassette tapes.

I hate my closet. How can I reorganize to make it more functional?,"Or maybe I just hate all of the mess in it. I'm super thankful to have this much storage in a rental, but the structure/how it is organized is not working for me. I think there is a lot of space to work with but it's not functioning well.

My biggest complaints: The left side of the closet (where that bed frame is stored) is barely accessible because it is so narrow. Storing shoes on the floor makes it even more difficult to get back there. Also not happy with the wood shelves. They are super deep (there is another row of boxes back there) and tall. Storing something low like shoes means a waste of vertical space. But having to pull down two rows of boxes to get to a t-shirt is inconvenient, and usually ends with me falling backwards or knocking things over.

Decluttering Experts,"On the 24th of January my mother came to me and asked me to help her declutter the bottom floor of their house. She and my father have a little granny flat type thing with a bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, laundry, and a garage. The garage isn’t used for cars, it’s all storage. So much storage, so much stuff. She specifically wanted my help because I’m a “stone cold bitch” when it comes to possessions, and don’t have any sentimental attachments to their stuff.

We were both busy the weekend of the 26th, so scheduled the big clean out for the weekend of the 2nd of Feb.

On the 29th of January, the rain started. And kept going, and going, and going. We got more than 2000mm of rain over a nine day period, and experienced the worst flood our city has had in over 200 years. And my parents home was smack on the river bank.

Needless to say, they got inundated. They had 140cm of water through their bottom floor. 

Yesterday the water went down enough that we were able to get back into the house. Everything was ruined. Everything. We’ve had to throw it all out. All the photos and momentos that were stored, all of mine and my sisters childhood possessions my mother had been holding onto. Thousands of dollars of power tools, and camping gear, and kitchenware, and linen. Everything.

We start out going up the escalator we're thinking,  WOW, this is cool, I see a few items for storage, think $3.99, I can afford  a few, toss them in the bag, see some things I cant live without here and there. We go to leave and figured out that they literally herd you through the store. Honest to god I felt like cattle the way we had to zig zag through each department.

Finally I see the registers and get excited,  I'm one step clo6to getting home to organize!!! My total was $160,but I got soo many things. ",0

The problem is, I can't seem to throw anything away, if it was up to me 90% of the stuff will be in the trash.

She then completely shuts down and will not even attempt to organize the things she doesn't want to thrown away she just puts it in a pile and washes windows or something. 

Her excuse is alway, ""I can use this for school when I start to work again"" (I doubt she will be working again and the shit is mostly old crap) or ""I can give that to so and so and they can use if for whatever"".

Problem is I don't believe any of that stuff will leave the house or if it does it will sit in the garage for months before it does. It just sits in the way.

Throw Garbage in the Garbage: Step one to digging out of my squalor,"1)Throw Garbage in the Garbage

Recognizing and acting on this principle can be harder to execute then it seems, in dire straights start with the obvious culprits and keep working on the more difficult attachments.


It's taken years for me to recognize less obvious garbage. Making it easier to physically chuck stuff, and starting with the easy stuff made it a habbit. I now look through the house every day scooping up any garbage I see. I have more garbage cans around the house then the average person, but for now I need that. 


Walking across the room to the garbage should not be hard,  lifting the lid, or opening the cabinet, but if it is, make provisions for that. If you are weary of stuffing big items in a small can or spilling the dustpan every time because it's too big to fit in the can.. Get a bigger can. If you see piles, get more cans in those areas. Set garbage day on the phone and remove all bags on that day.



There are so many different resistances, perceptions and dysfunctional views about the value and categorisation of things, this particular subject can feel impossible to conquer. Some steps I learned 5 years ago, others I am only learning to execute now. 



Kitchen Garbage

Food scraps, peels, broccoli stems, cheese wrappers, packaging, pasta boxes, used tin foil and plastic bags, tin cans, jars are all prone to piling up. The duty to recycle turns the disposal of these items into an ethical, moral and complicated multi step decision making process, rather then a one and done.


If the compost rots in the bucket and creates an unhealthy stench, or piles up in the freezer hiding real and valuable food.. Throw it in the bin until you can find a better process.


An unwashed tin can with dry tomato sauce in it can sit by the sink for weeks and soon multiply to a dozen if the guilt of saving the planet is making the process too complicated and turning it into impossible tasks.


The act of rinsing it out immediately would have been simple, but no one got to such a bad state because they were on top of things and able to do these 'simple' tasks. Ever second these guilt cans sit on the counter where the dirty dishes should go is a second of your life wasted on guilt, shame and a step deeper towards being buried by an insurmountable hoard of decisions and multi step tasks. 



Dirty dishes will begin to pile up on prep surfaces, making processed food the first choice, causing more pile ups of garbage, wrappers, boxes and eating utensils in other areas like the dining room table, living room and bedroom. 



They take up the designated and valuable space that keeps the system moving. Same goes for all other recycling receptacles.. if that pile by the door has overflowed the bin and is creating a tripping hazard or fire hazard because you can't make a quick exit, reduce the task to one step and throw it into the garbage. Keep that goal, but do it when you can really execute it, not just when you intend to but can not possibly during the circumstances. 



Cans, plastic containers, boxes other 'nice' storage solutions are a common trap. It's so easy to assign value to some of these things, when in reality there is no shortage of these items and that's apparent by the piles of them 'useful' items stuffed everywhere about the house. (Gotta love orange boxes.. but if you keep this stuff.. put it to use immediately. If it doesn't have a home it doesn't deserve to be kept in limbo waiting for a future commitment.)



 I can now afford to buy real containers, and now the garbage isn't piled up by the sink, and rotting food isn't a staple in the fridge it's amazing how few I need. This way I can avoid collecting margarine and yogurt containers, or feeling like I never have enough, like when they are full of rotting food, or sitting waiting to be cleaned by the sink. (The quantity you need also relates to the amount of containers that will fit in the cupboard and fridge without stuffing them)


Old Food

This piles up in the pantry, on the counter and in the fridge. For years I had to wait for that apple or lime to totally rot before it's 'trash'  In the fridge to avoid 'waste' I often wait subconsciously (even though I recognised this behaviour) until the food is totally rank, slimy and mouldy before I am able to throw it away. The disgusting containers pile up beside the sink for weeks until one of us is brave enough to wash them. Sometimes the rotten food is pulled out of the fridge and sits unopened in the container until judgement day.



Get used to throwing food out. I recoil at this thought, I hate waste and want to have a higher standard but often fall short. If you know in the back of your brain that you can't take another bite of that disgusting cooking failure, or you are just sick of that particular dish that you cooked too much of.. don't freeze it. 



That unloved garbage will clog up your freezer and you will loose good food, and end up throwing it all away when you eventually clean out and find it's all freezer burnt, along with the good food you could not locate.  Delaying this decision is a decision.. and one that leads to more waste. 



If you can't bring yourself to eat it, give yourself permission to throw it away and wash the container with joy, freeing it up fridge space for food prep or truly good food. 



Pantry food. Alot of my pantry clean-out attempts were met with so much resistance against waste that I kept stale crackers and noodles, if only because I could not bear to throw them away. This most recent clean-out the problem was not only inedibly stale pasta and dry goods, but canned food, well past its prime.. 4-5 years old, somehow escaping every clean-out but never used. These cans sat by the door for weeks, I'd rather trip over them and shuffle them then throw them away or complete the multi step process of opening them, rinsing them and recycling them.


 Finally, I opened the evaporated milk and was justified that it appeared thick, yellow and inedible. The can being so difficult to clean due to sharp edges and goop nearly caused me to leave the rest of the cans sitting there for the next decade. In a decisive move.. I threw them in the garbage. It was the only way I could deal with it in that moment. I recycle most things responsibly, and the healthier I become, the better my choices will be, but on this sliding scale, that was the best that I could do. 



They were garbage the minute I hoarded so much food in my pantry that I didn't even know what I had, and continued to re-buy until they died stuffed and hidden in the back of the cupboard. All this time I was thinking the pantry was too small... Amazing how much space opens up when the garbage is gone.



Bedroom

Dirty clothes that don't fit, ripped, stained, broken zippers, disgusting sheets, unused curtains, socks with holes or no matches. In my days of massive mountains of textiles and expensive laundry mat that needed to be babysat to avoid clothes theft it was impossible to work though such a massive pile.



Calculating the effort and sheer hours required to sort, sit by the machines, fold after, let alone not even having the space to put all of the folded/hung stuff in the room made it clear that this was never happening.



It was easier to buy more and more from the thrift shop to replace lost or dirty items, and to satisfy that need to get out of the house in search of sanity. Worn out items lived in the pile for years.. ""Just in case"" or because they were ""Nice"" or ""For Projects"" If I ever get to a project with ripped jeans I know now that a 'new' $3 pair will be awaiting me at the thrift store, and I can afford that.



If the clothes are filthy and irreparably stained- throw them out. If they are decently clean but ripped/unwearable/ donate them to a place that recycles textiles.. they often take old shoes too. 



Call them garbage and get them out. If they don't fit, you don't wear them.. donate them. Even if you have designer clothes, it's ridiculously hard to get any money back from them and the effort just isn't worth it. Sizing and style is so specific.. let the stores deal with all the try ons and choosy customers. Let some person score on an amazing thrift store find.


Unworn clothes, even nice ones, are worse then useless. The stingy mentality makes one self centered and helps no one.. Pass them on to someone else with generous thoughts. They have no value to you, take up valuable space and cause pile ups and squalor piles. When the amount of clothes is right for a space, its so much easier to put them away.. no stuffing required, no clean laundry living in baskets, no sort of clean laundry mounding up on the dresser. 



Broken and Unusable Stuff

That great picture frame that needs a bit of glue or some new glass. That footstool with a little wobble or waiting a needing a shabby chic makeover. The thing for a craft project. The lamp that needs new wiring and a lampshade.. but it was handed down from family. The reusable bag that's good except for the broken handles.. but it's a 'quick fix. The pants that need hemming to be worn. The $500 thrift store jacket score that was $20 but needs excessive alterations to fit (unless you can sell it or use it, its value is $0) The blender that has dull blades or smells like burnout every time you use it but ""the pitcher is still good and someone might want it as a replacement.. (But you will never find that person) the broken dish that could be glued (if you could find the glue and the motivation) The 'valuable' adorable nativity set missing the baby Jesus. You couldn't sell it without a multi step process of fixing, crafting or remaking.



All of it. Garbage. Worthless. More then worthless.. this stuff is hanging on like an abusive partner.. guilting, shaming, abusing you into a sad mental state, pushing you deeper into squalor. Some could be donated, some could be given away.. but if dealing with annoying no shows on facebook marketplace, and the multi step process of finding transportation to take to a donation center, will only end in a state of paralysis.. throw it out!.



Free yourself up from the guilt mountains of decisions, dead weight of stuff that just saps the life out of you by insisting ""don't waste me' 'what a shame' 'you CAN'T get rid of me for 'x' reason' 'I'm 'worth' ALOT' Adjust the worth in your head by calling them what they are.. a garbage roomate. Say hasta lavista and evict them.



You will not miss them.. Rather you will be glad they are gone and will only remember them when you realize down the road that like a bad relationship, you have blossomed now that they are gone and have mental clarity like you never had before. 



Atonement.

Everything has a price. We can't always meet our expectations and ideals. When hoarding teams up with depression and anxiety, my first thought is to do everything I can to avoid pain or decisions.. but that only drives me further down the black hole. 



Calling garbage what it is, and throwing it away makes me face up to how I have failed, wasted, let things slide. It's ok to be sad- use this as motivation to dig yourself out to a better path. 


Guilt, shame, disgust are familiar demons that all lead to more hoarding, decision paralysis and giving up. Embracing true sorrow and feeling it without trying to hide from the consequences, but standing accountable, admitting the fault and resolving to do better opens a door that leads to real change. It's like dynamite to this fortress of old habbits, wrong beliefs and dysfunctional ways of living. It lets the fresh are in again, and allows us to stop hiding, and start to feel and live again. 


Throw garbage in the garbage, if it's the one thing you can do, even just the lower hanging garbage, it's the first step to a healthier environment and better life.",declutter,1549924482,nspikeu,17,1,True,aplzmn,2019-02-11,"Throw Garbage in the Garbage: Step one to digging out of my squalor 1)Throw Garbage in the Garbage

Those little plastic sorting containers are great for pencils and gluesticks, but are useless for my 5'×5' paperboard and my big ass paper guillotine. It also doesn't help that my apartment is just 300 square feet.

Conquering anxiety about decluttering?,"I've struggled with organization and tidiness my whole life, and gone from driving my parents and teachers crazy to driving my sweet SO up a wall with my constant clutter. I want to be organized and tidy, I really do, but I just get so overwhelmed that I don't know where to start. I look at all the stuff that needs to be sorted and I just want to cry.

A lot of it is that I get anxiety about accidentally throwing something away that I'll need later, so I think I may have a dash of hoarding tendencies along with everything else.

KonMaring sentimental items from past relationships?,"While I have managed on decluttering in every category, I'm rather stuck on particular sentimental items.

I decluttered my side hustle and it feels amazing,"I’ve got one of those hobbies that everyone thinks you should turn into a side hustle, and after years of saying I wasn’t interested I launched my little store just over two years ago.


Once the initial excitement passed I realized I had been right—I wasn’t interested. But it was too late. I was already paying for a website and insurance. I’d spent a bunch of money and time on design and custom labelling and packaging, not to mention inventory. So I kept it. I did one market and that wiped my introverted ass out for days. I let it clunk away in the background, maybe getting one order a month, and usually cursing a bit when I did (crap, now I have to go to the post office, what a pain). I didn’t dare promote it lest I sell more and have to make more inventory. Ugh.



In the meantime, I was working on decluttering other aspects of my life. The recent Marie Kondo show on Netflix re-inspired me, and as I was chucking out shirts I avoided wearing and accepting that I’ll never be a nail polish person, I stumbled across a box of inventory on a shelf and decided it was high time I decluttered my side hustle.



So I did. I had a one-day blowout sale, cleared out my inventory, mailed it off, and shut the whole thing down. And holy crap; it feels amazing. It’s not that my mostly neglected side hustle was taking up much of my time, but I hadn’t realized how much mental space it was taking up. You know the feeling of deciding that you’re not actually going to go to an event that you never wanted to go to in the first place? It’s like that, x1000. No more wondering what I’m going to do and thinking “I should really work harder on that, I'm letting it down”. Nope. It’s just gone, and I am free to go back to what I love, minus the hustle.



I feel so light, so free, and so wonderfully unburdened. If you have any unwanted responsibilities you can declutter from your life, I highly recommend it.

Decluttering and Downsizing,"So two things that I did recently that I've meaning to for \~years\~:

I used to store all my Christmas ornaments and decorations in three large rubbermaid containers. The ornaments were in the half-size one, each haphazardly wrapped in tissue paper but otherwise free to roll around. I bought an ornament organizer: a cardboard box with drawers and dividers ([link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EMOFY6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to box), and now all my ornaments are organized by type and safer than ever. I also threw out a bunch of old and broken ornaments that we never used, consolidating three boxes down to one, plus the organizer. Now I won't feel so stressed out over putting up decorations next year!

Another thing I did was downsize my dishware. I had a old setting for eight given to me by a co-worker way back in 2000, and they aren't even pretty. Really, having a setting for eight means we could go longer without doing dishes, which is so lazy!  I mean, there's only two of us, and I never entertain, so there was no need for that many dishes. So this weekend I bought a setting for four in a pattern I actually like ([link](https://www.target.com/p/portel-stoneware-16pc-dinnerware-set-teal-project-62-153/-/A-52329927) to plates). I also got rid of a bunch of old glasses and plastic cups; you know that stuff in the back of the top shelf you never use?

Next thing I am thinking of doing is getting rid of the table near our kitchen that we use to store food (like bananas, bread, potatoes, onions, etc.) and getting a bakers rack type thing that's not as big depth-wise (the table is actually an extra end table) and I can hide stuff like onions and potatoes inside behind closed doors. The table as it is is like a junky catch-all for food (and the wifi router, lol). I don't have one in mind, something cheap, lol, and wooden with doors.

Decluttering my safety nest (seeking advice),"TL;DR having every surface of my space covered in clutter helps me feel secure/safe due to some unfortunate childhood stuff. How do I break this mindset?

I’ve always known that I have a less than healthy attachment to belongings but I’m finally at a point where I look at my surroundings and realize they’re not what I want for myself because I’m distracted 24/7, I can’t find anything and I waste money buying multiples. 

My problem is that every time I get rid of stuff and/or put everything in their homes, I have the compulsion to cover every surface either by acquiring more belongings or just dropping things and leaving them there. 

Seeing my belongings all around me helps me feel like I’m not poor (yay for growing up with a scarcity mindset) and making it hard for anyone to go into my room makes me feel protected (yay for super toxic parents who I’ve had to move back in with recently). 

If anyone has any tips for how I can undo this way of feeling/thinking, I would be really grateful. I’m hoping that by acknowledging that this is what I get out of maintaining my borderline hoarder bedroom, I can move on to internalizing better self-care practices. I just need some (a lot of) guidance on the “how”.",declutter,1548999961,Sweet_Item_Drops,15,1,True,alywtr,2019-02-01,"Decluttering my safety nest (seeking advice) TL;DR having every surface of my space covered in clutter helps me feel secure/safe due to some unfortunate childhood stuff.

"How to declutter 1,500 CDs and 500+ DVDs","My husband has an insane collection of music and movies and he barely ever touches most of it.

They’re currently on shelves in a big walk in storage closet that we want to use to expand our 1/2 bathroom into a full bath.

Decluttering against your will?,"Has anyone had decluttering forced upon them? 

At my old apartment, there was a water leak that caused mold at my old place. I had to get rid of about 80% of everything right then. This was several years ago and sometimes I still miss some of my jackets that got ruined, but life goes on. 

Today, I found out that my old university deleted all my files, such as reports, presentations, projects, etc.  So I guess that was more of an electronic decluttering. Tbh, I always thought they would be there and so I didn't store about 50% of them, just left them on the cloud. It feels so crappy and I'm just wondering what got lost.

It's ok not to donate,"I hope this doesn't rub anyone the wrong way, and I certainly love to shop at goodwill, but one of my main issues (originating in childhood) is being unable to give stuff away for free.

If I had to decide between tossing and donating, I'd be unable to declutter at all.  That may sound weird, but it's that extra step that I need to eliminate to be successful at this at all.

I just write this if anyone else is in a bit of a similar mindset and feels overwhelmed at the idea of donating items.  I've cleared my space, and that's what feels most important to me right now.",0

Embarrassing poetry from teenage years,"I don’t know how to categorize these items, but I have a large box full of journal/books from when I was 14 to 17 years old filled with my teenage angst poetry.

"I decluttered about a year ago using the Marie Kondo method, here is what I learned","A year ago I had a cardboard box sitting in the middle of my living room floor.  I was keeping it in case I would need it some day, and I would push it around from place to place every time I walked through the room.  I had socks and papers piled everywhere and sometimes on top of each other.  I had 15(!) dental flosses from various trips to the dentist.  At the time, I don't think I saw any of this as an issue that needed fixing.  I realize now, in hindsight, that this may have been an error!

A year ago I was on a flight and, on a whim, I checked out the Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up.  After reading the book,  I got motivated to try out the steps that it suggested.  I think I got motivated because it made me question if being 'untidy' was just part of my personality, or something that could be changed.   I asked a few friends of mine who I thought of as 'tidy' people, and they didn't seem to be sure either. 

I aggressively followed the instructions from the book and tidied everything up until I was finished. Deciding what to get rid of was not as  hard as I thought it would be - I had a lot of stuff that was obviously trash that just needed to get thrown away.  The cardboard box in the middle of the living room was a really good example.

It was a very satisfying feeling when everything was finished, and  I had a neat floor to walk on and my little shrine in the corner that has my puppet collection and photos of family members. 

A year later, my apartment is much neater than it was, and I feel like I can do a little more because I am living in a neater space.  I still have the processes and strategies that I learned for keeping tidy.  I don't necessarily always practice them - I presently am sitting next to a mountain of unsorted papers, and a bucket of no less than 15 pens.  But its comforting to know that I have a strategy for dealing with that clutter; and I know what the results of decluttering can be.

So overall, I would say, it is possible for an 'untidy' person to learn how to be 'tidy'.  Or at least to learn how to be tidier. 

So if you are thinking about tidying up and are on the fence -  I'd say 'throw away that fence if it doesn't bring you joy' - and give it a shot!

Getting my house in order,"tl;dr: Cleaned a bunch of my old junk out of my parents house, any advice for getting siblings to do the same?

My family went through a lot of moves prior to and immediately after my heading to college. We packed up my childhood home for moving in the spring, and then had major remodeling work done there over the summer, while we stayed in a small place temporarily. I moved directly from this temporary house to college, and in the fall, the rest of my family finally moved to their new house. This resulted in a lot of our stuff being in complete disarray.

I don't want to blame the situation, what happened happened, but through this current process (10 years later), I'm really wishing I'd just gotten rid of so much more stuff at the first opportunity.

Over the time since this move, I've had my own series of moves through apartments and other housing. My parents and siblings have too, leading to a closet and basement of stuff being ""parked"" and waiting for who knows what to transpire. I've had a few opportunities (typically moving) to get rid of some stuff, but I often used the same excuses to push stuff back to my parents basement: ""oh, this was a gift,"" ""I'll use this someday when I have a bigger house,"" etc.

Some nervous energy during this latest gov't shutdown prompted me to take care of things in earnest. At first, it was just ""oh, I really should finally take this plastic bag of clothes to Goodwill,"" but I very quickly realized there was a lot more I needed to deal with. Once I finished with my own closet, I drove to my parents house, and cleared an entire pickup-truck bed of items. Of these items, I'd say 93% went straight to a dumpster, 5% were donated, and 2% were kept. Sure, I discovered a few old items of clothing that had been lost in the shuffle and I'd missed, but I found many more that were literal garbage: stained, elastic dried out, torn.

Having completed this made doing the rest of my own house a much more streamlined process. When putting things away, there was no question of ""what about the \_\_\_\_\_ still stored at the parents house?"" because there was none. There are no more boxes that I might be called in the future to ""take care of this from the closet"" and now have to integrate into my own stuff.

Some surprises from the whole project:

* There was a box with a bunch of old school papers. Things like math and drawing from 2nd grade. I guess neither of my parents wanted to be the one to toss it, but nobody was going to look through this box again either. It felt good to say ""these are *mine*"" (each one has my name written at the top!), and they have 100% served their purpose.
* It was very helpful to do this during the day when nobody was in the house. With some things, I could hear particularly my dad's voice (he's the packrat of the family), saying ""but that was from your first bike race"" and such. Nobody was missing these things before, because they were in water-stained boxes at the bottom of a pile, and I needed no friction to tossing them out.
* I'd envisioned donating so much more than I actually did. Nobody wants stained or torn clothing, and a donation organization is going to toss these anyhow. Similarly, nobody is going to want a 10 year old college textbook, especially one that needs a code # for online homework. It was fun to pull up to a thrift store, watch their eyes widen at the contents of the truck bed, to only to set a small box of clothing and books on the curb and drive off. The rest was literal garbage.
* Regrets from the process? Surprisingly small compared to the quantity of stuff I got rid of. There was a glove I tossed, only to find its mate later. There was a book I donated (#2 and #3 of a set), only to find that my wife has #1-2 and is missing #3.

The next steps? Convincing my siblings to do the same. One closet that I worked in looks almost identical to when I started, because of boxes and bags of their clothing. They both had some difficult periods in their late teens / early 20s, and I know there are some bad memories buried away in those items. 

I had a little urge to just toss some of the bulk of the stuff alongside mine, but of course it's not mine to do so with (and maybe there's some cathartic/spiritual thing they'd miss by not seeing what was thrown out?). I'm thinking of calling them up and asking if they want me to take care of the clear-cut items (one lives out of town, so he doesn't have as much time for this), but maybe they don't want their older brother going through some of this stuff?

On the other hand, it may be a service to them. I'm thinking that they both went through some addiction issues (for which these things may be a trigger), and are really very different people from when this stuff was packed away. Anyone who has gone through similar (either cleaning others stuff, or having your stuff dealt with) is welcome to give their take.

Collection of Small space ideas?,"Hi everyone, 

I am looking for somewhere that there might be a collection of gadgets or useful ideas to maximise on space as I live in a very small apartment.

Also don’t currently have a toaster in the kitchen and wondering how I can incorporate one without taking up too much space.

How to declutter someone else’s house?,"My husband and I live with his grandmother, who isn’t in great health so she stays in bed most of the time. I clean and cook and pretty much do everything at the house which I don’t mind most of the time, but between her stuff and my stuff, my husband being messy and having a 2 year old, I get extremely stressed out about the constant mess and clutter. 

I try my best to put things away and keep things looking neat, but she buys things and expects me to find places for them, I buy my own things for when my husband and I move out, and on top of that she has a bunch of stuff that she has accumulated over the years and either doesn’t know about it or wants to keep it for no reason. Or she will throw out a bunch of stuff, and then buy a bunch of stuff, so it’s the same amount, just different.

On top of that, the basement. She has boxes and boxes of things along with random items strewn around, broken items, multiples of the same item, furniture that’s probably never going to get used, etc. when I moved in I kept my boxes separate and where I could easily get to them, so that when it was time to move, my boxes wouldn’t be all over the place.

I try my best to put things away and keep things looking neat, but she buys things and expects me to find places for them, I buy my own things for when my husband and I move out, and on top of that she has a bunch of stuff that she has accumulated over the years and either doesn’t know about it or wants to keep it for no reason. Or she will throw out a bunch of stuff, and then buy a bunch of stuff, so it’s the same amount, just different.

On top of that, the basement. She has boxes and boxes of things along with random items strewn around, broken items, multiples of the same item, furniture that’s probably never going to get used, etc. when I moved in I kept my boxes separate and where I could easily get to them, so that when it was time to move, my boxes wouldn’t be all over the place.

Clutter and Renovations?,"Hey guys, so I’ve been having some major decluttering wins around our house, like, down to the last two spaces that need clearing kind of wins. But we are also starting some big ish renovations.

Today we had to pull apart our kitchen closet that holds our mugs and glasses and small appliances, so that it could be painted and refinished into a office/cupboard hybrid type thing. And all of it’s contents ended up in my craft room. In a few weeks we will be emptying out our kitchen so that we can paint the cabinets and get ready for new counters and tiling etc, which will mean even more kitchen crap all over.

How does everyone else deal with clutter during reno’s? Do you move it all into one room, and shut the door on it, or do you put parts of it in different rooms so that it doesn’t disrupt each room too much?

As it stands, I won’t be able to use my craft room at all until we are able to put the office/closet back together, which is looking like at least a week, maybe more.

Decluttering craft supplies,"I've already decluttered a lot of my stuff, but am really struggling with craft supplies.

I have items for:

\- crochet (including way more yarn than one could ever need)

\- drawing

\- embroidery

&amp;#x200B;

When I was moving last year, 1/4th of all my stuff was actually craft supplies (which equates to 4 boxes but is still way more than I need).

I think the reason why I struggle with craft supplies is because they were often gifts I got from friends or family and/or they're often on the expensive side. I probably have 100+ euros of yarn in my room, but there's no way I'm ever going to be able to use all of it (also because some of it is wool and I prefer cotton yarn - but for some reason I keep it just in case).

&amp;#x200B;

I also think some of it are aspirational items: stuff that makes me look like who I want to be, but not who I am. Example: I want to be good at embroidery, so I buy lots of embroidery supplies in the hope that that will make me better, instead of just practicing embroidery. Or: I buy the exact painting brushes someone on the internet recommended instead of just using what I own, like the brushes are going to suddenly make me a master painter.

Getting rid of 5 things a day,"Hello!

I’ve always been a fan of decluttering but was never die hard about it. In December I decided I would get rid of 5 things a day for all of January.

Does anyone else get stressed about other people’s clutter? (I’m looking at you MIL!),"Earlier this year my mother in law lost her husband and had to move out of her quite large house to a small two bedroom apartment.

My husband took a lot of his time (away from me and our baby) to help her get rid of so much stuff and I was really impressed of how  unattached she was to the things they threw out and how much she was willing to part with, considering she has hoarding tendencies and a shopping addiction. 

Anyways, I was also kinda relieved  because I thought that by doing this now, the work of clearing out her stuff when she’s gone one day, wouldn’t be so time consuming - I know it’s morbid but I have a mom who always preaches about not wanting her children to be burdened by her stuff when she passes away, so I it’s in the back of my mind often. However, when we visited her a few weekends ago I saw she had already bought so much stuff again in the few months after she moved.

Literally, the second bedroom alone was just stuff piled from floor to ceiling with books, clothes, more toys than you can imagine (she has three, soon four, grandchildren who visit her maybe once a month for a few hours, so no need), knitting supplies and storage boxes that were, ironically enough, filled up with smaller empty storage boxes.

WTF. She basically spent what I imagine is the entire inheritance on stuff that’s just waiting to be thrown out again.

First, it made me sad to think about her lack of self control and the fact that she uses shopping and stuff as a coping mechanism. But afterwards I just became angry because my husband spent so much time helping her declutter just so that she could buy stuff all over again. Lastly, it just stresses me out that one day we’ll be the one left with clearing all that crap out ...

Help! Incredibly messy barn,"We're about to start decluttering/deep cleaning an extremely messy old barn, to use as an artist's studio. It's a beautiful location that will definitely be worth it, but I'm not looking forward to getting started with the cleanup.

The room we will mostly be using is an open space that is just... strewn with random crap. Just 30 years of ""yeah, chuck it in the barn"". ""Get your tetanus shots"" kind of stuff. Old pieces of wire, disassembled furniture, cobwebs, wood scraps/boards, paint buckets... There's also a small workshop area that hasn't been used in years as far as I know, so there's also some rusty tools. We might be able to mobilise someone or a few people to help with basic, final cleanup and smaller stuff, but mostly it will just be me and my husband. We have pretty much no experience with clutter of this magnitude.

I'm struggling to figure out a way to even get started.

"Decluttering with a ""collector"" spouse?","So as background info, my husband collects what we call ""nerd stuff."" It started out with cool or rare Halo, Pokemon, Star Wars, and Star Trek items. I didn't have a problem with it because I enjoy those things too and he kept everything displayed tastefully and contained to a large bookshelf and the shelves in his armoire.  

&amp;#x200B;

It used to be just stuff he really enjoyed, but now it includes things that he doesn't even have much interest in. It seems like he has things just to be able to say he has them. Like he has collector's edition steel cases and game guides for video games we don't even have and have no interest in playing. He has some of those statue things that come with collector's edition video games that he only bought because they were on sale. He has so many Halo figures that the majority have been unceremoniously thrown into a pile in the armoire. He keeps buying Pops for any show/movie/game that we ever enjoyed. He's kept the boxes for his special edition video game consoles, which take up half of our linen closet. He has over 20 Nerf guns that never get used.

Even all the decor in our house - posters, knick-knacks, etc - are part of his collection.

Personalised Gifts,"Hi all,

So my husband and I are trying to have a serious spring clean and declutter. We are moving house mid year and so want to get everything in order, so we don't take loads of crap with us when we go. 

Over the years, we have accumulated personalised gifts that are not to our taste so have hidden them away in the cupboard. Specifically, my mother in law got us a personalised photo frame recently (no special occasion, just because) and said that next time she visited she wanted to see it put to use. However, it is not something we would have ever bought for ourselves, and I would go as far as to say I find it a bit tacky. I appreciate that she bought us this gift and don't want to be ungrateful but I don't think we'll ever use it.

The trophy problem,"I'm in a bit of quandry regarding my old ballroom dance trophies. Danced for nearly 10 years as child/teen, competed nationally, but stopped about 10 years ago now.

However, these aren't great quality trophies, mostly plastic figurines on marble bases. I don't display them because ballroom isn't something I do any more. Really all I do is store them in plastic boxes and hunk them around every time I move house. But equally I'm feeling conflicted about getting rid of them. It's not like I have a strong sentimental attachment to them but I do feel obligated to keep them. Added to this, at present they aren't taking up too much storage so I'm not sure the impetus to get rid of them is there.

I'd store them at my parents but my mum has an issue with far too much stuff that is meticulously tidied away (she hoards stuff but is obsessive keeping the house clean, orderly and on the face of it, minimal in decor) so me stashing items back there will just mean I hear no end of how she has too much stuff.

What To Do With Old Video Game Consoles?,"While going through my bin of electronics to see what I might not need anymore, I came across my old SNES and the few games I had kept.

So now I'm considering letting the SNES and its games go, and if I find I really want to play any of these games again I can set up a Retropie or something to emulate games.

How Long To Keep These Documents - Paper Clutter,"FTP, LTL, Mobile App and too long acrylics atm so sorry for formatting/ spelling issues if any 

I searched the sub and found a few tidbits, but not exactly an answer that satisfied me. I am still swimming in paper clutter despite having a date night with my shredder a month ago. 

What I know: 

W-2s, tax returns, and such - 7 years

Bills, Statements, and the like - at least keep most recent bill or statement but I personally keep the last 3  to be safe

Kids artwork/schoolwork I cull on a grading period basis as she's in elementary school still and there's plenty of papers to deal with. 


What I'm struggling with : 

Contracts and registrations to vehicles I no longer own, work contracts for jobs I no longer have, Unemployment paperwork from 2015, paperwork from the two universities I no longer attend, old leases. 

It's not quite clear to me if I should keep any of this for any length of time after I no longer have/utilize these things/services.

Getting over that *One Thing* you keep putting off,"Wow, I think this might be my first post here. Hi everyone!! 

I graduated with my master's degree in May of 2018 and I finally started to declutter and let go of years and years of stuff I don't need. Almost every single month I've been cutting down the things I own and basically, what I've learned is that I carried it as baggage. Two years of grad school set me back emotionally quite severely. I was putting all of my emotions--pain and fear and anger-- into my things. I don't think I ever really threw anything away. I could barely get my things into 2 trips in the fully empty back of a Chevy Trailblazer vehicle. It's incredibly embarrassing for me to admit that. 

[Here's the hard part](https://imgur.com/gallery/FEw6PfS). I did okay with the declutter of most of my stuff but I struggled with and subsequently put off dealing with my academic records. This is a standard sterilite storage tub filled to the brim with a ton of notes, damn near everything I wrote on paper. Everything I printed. I was finally able to just *let go* and you can see that I kept one binder and expanding file (for my bills)! I can't wait for the rest of my first 30 Days of Minimalism!

Had a decluttering win in my craft room!,"[Clean and tidy craft room!](https://imgur.com/a/4cYQcTR)

I had been putting off cleaning my craft room for months, because it was so daunting and I just KNEW I’d need to buy an extra storage unit, even though I was planning to get rid of a lot of stuff. I had stuff piled up on all the desks (even the tiny computer desk), on top of every storage unit, and all over the floors. My sewing machines had to live on the floor when I wasn’t using them because there was just no where else to put them.

Turns out, I didn’t need extra storage, I just needed to put everything away properly! I even ended up with empty shelves in my existing storage! And, I actually barely got rid of anything, just lots of packaging that took up way too much space.

This was definitely a labour of love, and took me just about three full days to get done. When I started I was only planning to tidy the main storage, so emptied everything in it out onto my dining table, but once I’d done that I figured I may as well keep going, so the whole room got emptied.

How to decide how to tackle different groups of items?,"I live in a big house and i feel like I’m in a constant process.  Just been watching Marie Kondo and I understand her theories sorting by types of item but it’s really had to start and actually finish. I think I show my leanings towards hoarding by often thinking I’ll put that aside and sell it instead of getting rid of it right away, because I can always use Shpock or local FB groups etc.  But then there is always more to do!! Or it becomes another to do item: find a value for x, list it arrange pick up etc.  

So then I stagnate, shelves don’t get cleared and I don’t move forward with what needs to be done like sorting out the furniture we need to buy - Because there are small amounts of crap in the way of everything.  

Other barrier is sentimental attachments - love of certain groups of magazines that I give value to because I love magazines, for example.  Just don’t know how to let them go even when I don’t look at them.  Many, many items that I have similar attachments to. 

Also as a parent I have little time to read but I believe that I will come back to reading more once the kids are more independent.  This stops me from getting rid of books.  How do you change this thinking?? How do you let go of things that you want in your future even tho you could buy them again etc? We have A LOT of books that don’t move  but when I look at them I want to read them one day.

Other barrier is sentimental attachments - love of certain groups of magazines that I give value to because I love magazines, for example.  Just don’t know how to let them go even when I don’t look at them.  Many, many items that I have similar attachments to. 

Also as a parent I have little time to read but I believe that I will come back to reading more once the kids are more independent.  This stops me from getting rid of books.  How do you change this thinking?? How do you let go of things that you want in your future even tho you could buy them again etc? We have A LOT of books that don’t move  but when I look at them I want to read them one day.  ",0

A practice to increase tranquility,"Every week, perhaps on a certain day of the week, resolve to organize the flat surfaces (tables) in your home.  By flat surfaces, I mean desk, kitchen counter, dining table, nightstand next to the bed and entryway table, as examples.  Remove items that should be disposed of in the trash, put away items that need to go back in storage and generally organize things and put them into a conciously chosen arrangement.

Why is this such a satisfying exercise? The flat surfaces in your home serve to allow you room to transfer items from storage to a place that you can use them, inspect them, determine what to do with them and dispose of them.  In this case storage might mean organized shelf storage, or it might mean bulk piles of clutter in random boxes.  The flat surfaces in your home are the tools you need to organize clutter.

Putting a day on the calendar to organize your flat surfaces and following through by regular application of this practice adds to tranquility by creating a feeling of control over one's living area.

Clearing an Estate,"So I cleared an estate 2 years ago which tooks months.  I just had to do another and it took about 2 and a half weeks even though there was just as much stuff, if not more.  I was less sentimentally attached to this one so that helped.

But boy did it make me think I must throw things out.  Soooo many books not looked at in years.  Tons of cleaning products, yet the place was filthy.  Family heirlooms he had hoarded and hidden away so they weren't enjoyed and now the other relatives that they would have meant something to are too old to care about having them anymore.  Every piece of paper he had ever gotten in his life, bills, legal stuff etc.  Most of which was put in plastic envelopes which are a pain because to send them for shredding you have to take the stuff out.  Every piece of clothing ever owned.  Photos shoved in boxes in envelopes that nearly got thrown out.  About 10 mobile phones.  Thousands of empty cigarette packets.  No they are NOT collectible.  Dusty trinkets and knick knacks everywhere.  Tons of keys...for what?  Tons of locks with no keys that matched.  And my personal favourite...a Betamax video player...yes that's right a Betamax!  No tapes and no cords to go with it.  Plus much much more.

2 skips, 2 hard rubbish collections, several bin collections and multiple trips to charity stores.  There was probably some saleable stuff but I COULD NOT BE BOTHERED and that made a huge difference.  Let it go!

Now if people could stop dying so that I had to clear their houses I might be able to sort out some of my own junk!

Century Old Guilt,"Does anyone have tips for dealing with antiques that are not valuable? 

I’m helping my mom clean out her house (so thankful she’s willing to do this while she’s still able to assist) and she just has so many antiques. So everything she pulls out of a box is my great-grandmother’s wedding china from 1908. Or miniature glassware that someone dragged here from the old country in 1892 that has been carefully preserved unbroken for 126 years. Or like a crazy medical encyclopedia from 1915. And she has SO MUCH of it and everything I say I don’t want makes her feel bad and then I feel awful. 

I have NO problem chucking out old blankets and Tupperware from the 1970’s. And I know no one wants giant hulking brown furniture anymore. But this super old stuff kills me. 

She had one antique buyer come through and they bought some stuff but left a ton. So I assume what’s left is not at all valuable. But it seems way too nice to just dump on the curb. I’ve seen our donation collection guy come through and he literally hurls boxes into the back of the truck so it might as well just be going in the trash. 

Any ideas for how to honorably dispose of this stuff? I just feel like it deserves a better end than a set of cracked Ikea dishes. ",declutter,1547073706,photoshoppedunicorn,23,1,True,aecci7,2019-01-09,"Century Old Guilt Does anyone have tips for dealing with antiques that are not valuable?

December Declutter - progress and thoughts as I near the end,"Hey everyone!   


Wanted to share my progress from this past week:

* Three boxes of items donated to the thrift store 
* One bag of linens donated
* Decluttered my Christmas decor as I put it away today - can't believe how much stuff is just a one season use. I purchased my decor from Target and by the end of the season the glue was coming off of items, things were falling apart, and some things just didn't make it.  One of my snow globes broke as I was putting it away, that cleanup was not fun.
* Used Command hooks for my entryway to hang our keys (solved a major problem of my husband losing his)

Left to do:

* One more round on my closet 
* One more round on my books
* One more round on stationary 
* Wash all remaining linens

Thoughts from the past week:

1. I have no idea why I purchased so many items from Bath and Body Works on Black Friday and I ended up returning almost all of them.  I really don't enjoy using candles except on holidays and could have done with one or two for fall/winter. I also realize that I have a hypersensitive smell and most scents bother me. 
2. From now on I need to weigh the quality of items before I buy them. Will this fall apart? Is this going to last? 
3. I am going on a complete stationary buying ban for the foreseeable future.
4. Struggling really hard with being kind to myself as I realize how much money I have wasted this year. I have chosen not to sell anything because I don't want the hassle of dealing with people on Facebook, Poshmark, or Craiglist. I don't want to have to deal with fees and shipping costs. I stand by this decision but It's hard not to count up what you have wasted while doing this.

Thanks for the continued support!

UPDATE: Cleaning out Dad's shed as his Christmas present.,"Disclaimer - The shed is not done. It still needs a lot of work but I'm still proud of the progress my dad, partner and I made. 

Hello Declutter! I'm the poster from the ""My Parents are Hoarders"" thread. Here's how it went.

Early Boxing Day morning, the troops got up and faced The Shed. A place of haphazardly placed tools, boxes full of books, clothes, shampoo bottles and old work papers and miscellaneous furniture and broken objects. We pulled out the problem area's stuff we wanted to focus on, placed it all on a tarp outside and pulled everything out. 


This is not my stuff, so there were things kept against my own judgement but for the sake of my parents. However, things that were thrown into the ""Get That Thing Out Of Here Or So Help Me"" pile were:


* Unmatched tupperware
* Ugly, never been open gifts
* Shitty applicances with fraying cords (back when the cords were covered with some sort of fabric) 
* Pointless papers on staff meetings, old school method texts, old stationery, blank Christmas cards 
* Damaged things (either from storing or from before they were stored but packed anyway!) 

Things that were kept:

* Clothes unless obviously damaged
* Sooo many books, including magazines too
* Nice and not nice kitchenware 
* Photos, letters and work notes in my Grandma's handwriting.

Even though it wasn't everything I wanted to do, we did a lot and I'm super proud. The plan for the future is these boxes can be taken out one at a time and examined by my parents for further decluttering. There has been a huge improvement in the space in the shed and will hopefully be the jumping point to get the rest into order as well, now there is a comfortable working space to do it in.

Letting reluctant family members run their (slow) course with decluttering.,"Does anyone else find it way less stressful to do this?

What I mean is, a certain person/people are often predictable in how they handle clutter, going something like this:

\- *""Keep, I think I'll use it.""*

\-  Later, never used: *""Keep, I'll give it away or sell it.""*

\- Much later, never given away/sold. It's now outdated/replaced/ruined/zero motivation or whatever. *""Yeah screw it, get rid of it.""*

This pattern used to frustrate me to no end, because the outcome was the same as just getting rid of it in the first place. Eventually I just got desensitized to the whole process, and to avoid argument/stress, I just store it in a designated place that they're aware of. Then I wait for it to run its course of indecision, neglect, and eventual discarding. I don't nag, just every few months if it hasn't been touched I bring it out and say *""Do you still want this?""* and whatever they decide is fine, even if I know it's just going to continue to sit there.",declutter,1546043714,SufficeItToSay,7,1,True,aag6kl,2018-12-28,"Letting reluctant family members run their (slow) course with decluttering.

cleaned out the tools/fix-it shelf,"I cleaned out and reorg'd the tool/fix-it shelf in our storage closet in the apartment building basement. Before, there were two new toolboxes sitting on in front, and every shelf was jammed solid.

I knew I had more tools that I use, that were in the way, so I put pics up on Facebook and asked all my male relatives and fix-it friends which I should keep. So it was a fun way to connect to some people too. (one friend said, ""I felt like I was watching an episode of 'This Old Tool.'"")

I ditched the beat-up red metal toolboxes that used to sit on the floor and stick out about 4 inches; the tools I pared down to now fit in the yellow toolbox (though I put the screwdrivers and hammer in a fabric caddy and hung it on a hook so I can reach them without having to take the toolbox out).

That space on the floor turns out to exactly hold a Rubbermaid storage tub I already had, so I put the stuff we won't use often but still want to keep (plumbing things, locksets, electrical).

I moved the socket wrench set into a vintage socket-wrench box from the ReStore. I think I can still pare that down; I just ran out of steam. My brother raised the idea of buying a new set that comes in a caddy already.

I trimmed the contents of the boxes of hooks, and of feet. I made new boxes for things like L-brackets, corner braces, metal straps, and hinges; those had been hiding in the bottom of a toolbox and were hard to find. But I sometimes use them, so they need to be easier to get to.

"I've had an obsession with hoarding ""nature stuff"" since I was a kid. How to declutter?","I was one of those kids who spent all their time hiking, running around parks, etc. I also have an obsession with collecting pretty sticks, stones, (clean) bones, shells, etc. Don't worry, I always check laws.

How much do you keep of childhood items?,"I've begun the large task of slowly decluttering my room in preparation for hopefully moving out of my parents' house and into an apartment with my boyfriend in 2019. I don't want to move things I don't have to, and I also don't want to leave much if anything at my parents' house. I've been taking items out to throw out and donate, and taking pictures as I go as each item has its own specific memory and feeling attached to it, but I don't feel I need the actual item anymore.

I have a ridiculous amount of small toys and knick-knacks from a good 15 or so years ago (I'm 25, just for perspective), that I've kept around mostly because I'm extremely sentimental. I'm finding that owning things like a Little Mermaid figurine from McDonald's a silly waste of space, but I've gone through old jewelry from when I was very young and cannot part with all of it, even though I know I will never wear any of it and some of it is bad quality that has tarnished over the years.

In the middle of a major purge,"So I have three daughters, and I've saved hand-me-downs between kids. The youngest is now three, so it's time to get rid of anything smaller than her current size.

I've gone through every bin (those big Rubbermaid tubs, one per size) from 24 months through size 12 (stuff that's still a little big for the oldest). I haven't tackled the baby clothes yet (newborn through 18 months, three bins total).

I have already taken an enormous load of stuff, mostly clothes, to a local thrift store, and I have enough to fill the car again, but I can't make it back there till Friday.

But here's the WTF part. I knew our guest room was a disaster. I knew it was covered in stray toys and shoes and winter coats and books and you couldn't see the bed.  But the weirdest stuff I've found has been *in* the clothes bins.

Summer 2020, or whenever the youngest needs size 5 clothes, she has a bin with 13 dresses, 13 complete outfits, 13 t-shirts, and that includes three birthday t-shirts. Apparently we thought we were dressing triplets. :P And that's after I took out anything I didn't like.

Then in the size 6 bin we have ELEVEN PAIRS of long-sleeved cotton pajamas. This is a bin I was just packing up today after gathering all of the middle child's outgrown clothes from a dresser, a laundry basket, and ?? I don't even remember.

Culling before a move,"My family is looking to move to a new place in April. We have already begun decluttering and simplifying to prepare, and it has been immensely satisfying and a giant relief. In the last few weeks we have gradually gotten rid of: 

- Books that we haven’t read in years or will never read and were just taking up space

- A chair that has sat in the corner for years and people rarely sit in

- A mountain of DVDs and a giant DVD stand

- Clothes and shoes out the wazoo

- Miscellaneous half-used wrapping paper and ribbons

- A bunch of stuff from a late relative’s house that we’d been holding for “sentimental value” but which really had no value at all

- Kitchen items that we had owned for five years and never used

- A ton of cheap kid tchotchke items unearthed from the corners of our kids’ rooms (balsa wood airplanes, yo-yos, random pens, doll pants &amp; shoes, fast food toys, plastic cups, museum gift shop junk, etc).

Today, my wife and I went through some coffee-table style books that we’d had for ages and konmari’d them. It was eye-opening for her! I’ve been made fun of for asking the joy question during previous declutterings, but I think she’s understanding that approach now. “I’ll read this someday” or “The kids might want to look at this when they are older” doesn’t fly.

We are making good progress! I’m hoping we can chip away at it a little each week and even have stuff that we want to take with us pre-boxed and stacked in the garage by the time we hit moving month to make everything less stressful.

Huge task ahead of me - Help!,"Okay. So here I am, sitting in a dark room of a roach infested apartment. I have less than 48 hours to pack everything up into Rubbermaid bins until the treatment begins. Im at a loss. So my plan was to start in my room and move forward, but all 3 of my lamps burnt out and I’m broke as shit and now I’m sitting in my room in the dark terrified to touch anything in case a bug runs out at me. 

So let’s rewind. I live in a 2 bedroom community housing apartment with my 2 kids. The building is quite small - 6 units, 3 on each side. The problem has been gradually growing for a few years and now it’s unbearable. There was a large spike in population when my mental health went off the wall and the house was covered front to back in garbage and laundry and other shit. It was so bad cops got involved. Anyways, kids are fine and with me, got some extreme clean folks to come help with the clutter but now stuff is cluttered again (no garbage just stuff and clothes). So I’m trying to get this place prepped by Friday morning. As it stands pretty much nothing is packed, I got laundry going. There’s a few issues. 

1. A lot of furniture has to go as it’s infested, that’ll happen Friday morning. 

2. Deep clean (lots of residue on walls and ceiling) will happen after the treatment.

3. We’ve been treated many times over 2 years and nothing has worked so they’re doing a roach clean out with Actisol. That happens next Friday. This Friday is junk removal (bye couches.. :( ) and some kind of vacuum treatment? 

4. When I say it’s infested, I mean I can count over 20 chilling and in a corner on the wall. I move stuff and hundreds scatter. Like it’s bad. 

Anyways, any tips, help or advice would help. I don’t have the time to do actual declutter now, so the plan is to pack up all these Rubbermaid containers (roaches love cardboard!) and then duct tape them shut, do at least 2 rounds of treatment, then have someone come in a professionally clean (provided by a social worker with the housing program I’m in), and then unpack slowly and declutter then.

Gifted two items from my gift stash!,"At some point in my adult life I started keeping a gift stash.  My mom had that habit so it’s kind of in my genes I guess.

December Declutter Progress updates,"I got a lot of great support on my last post and wanted to update on my continued progress!

* Cleaned out my fridge and freezer
* Cleaned out my kitchen cupboards (cups, plates, etc)
* Threw out a lot of worn out Tupperware
* Brought some cookies and candies to my work that although delicious, would have guaranteed at least 5 lbs of weight gain (they were gone in 5 minutes)
* Returned $90 worth of items to Bath and Body Works for store credit, which will easily be my budget for candles/soaps next year. 
* Returned $100 worth of stuff to Target, most went directly back to my credit card (which will lower the balance)
* Went through all of my bathroom items and toiletries 
* Went through my papers and recycled/shredded a nice stack
* Organized all of our important paperwork
* Threw out a HUGE contractor bag from this declutter

I am now on vacation for the next 12 days. In the next day or two I want to tackle:

* My linens
* My hallway closet which is mostly just storage (a complete nightmare)

"Convince me it's environmentally better to declutter, purge, and bulk donate","I don't think I'm really attached to my clutter, but here are some of my hangups:

* excess number of t-shirts that I would wear eventually as others wear out, holding on to them means I don't need to buy new ones, not sure where to donate that wouldn't end up in a landfill or something else less useful.

College student with TOO MUCH SHIT.... seriously desperate,"Honestly not even sure what to do. Have tried so hard to narrow it down to things I can try and sell but because I'm in pharmacy school, I don't have that much time (but obviously need the extra cash)

The Library Book,"*My family was big on the library. We were very much a reading family, but we were a borrow-a-book-from-the-library family more than a bookshelves-full-of-books family. My parents valued books, but they grew up in the Depression, aware of the quicksilver nature of money, and they learned the hard way that you shouldn’t buy what you could borrow. Because of that frugality, or perhaps independent of it, they also believed that you read a book for the experience of reading it. You didn’t read it in order to have an object that had to be housed and looked after forever, a memento of the purpose for which is was obtained. The reading of the book was a journey.

Declutter and babyproofing in January,"I am planning a declutter month for January! I am posting here to help me stick to it.


My husband and I live in a 2 bed apartment with our baby. She turns 1 in February. She currently can crawl, loves pulling up on furniture, and puts everything in her mouth. This is my motivation: having more space for her to play and removing random junk that could be hazards. (And removing clutter in general). 


A challenge is I only have a couple hours after she goes to bed as free time. Usually I do an hour of chores (dishes, laundry, put away toys) and an hour of TV, so time is a limiting factor.  For January my goal is to do a little bit of decluttering every night.


Areas I want to address: 


Her closet: she has the biggest closet in the apartment so we are storing our linens in there, old gift bags that can be reused, my wedding dress, baby devices (little chairs,  small bassinet) she has outgrown, and other random items. 


My closet: since pregnancy my clothes just don't fit well at all. I wear the same few outfits in rotation and have many old clothes just hanging there. I need to do a major purge and replace some items carefully.


Bathroom: I've done a good job downsizing expired meds and random items, but meds/first aid/toiletries are just stored in baskets on shelves, with more toiletries in the drawers under the sink. I'd like to organize, minimize and store it in closed plastic tubs, a little safer than just in baskets. 


So it's a declutter, organization and babyproofing project! If anyone has any tips or advice, I would love to hear it!

How I worked past sentimentality,"I have a big trunk from camp. I decided everything that is useless but I can't bring myself to toss would go in there. It'd be my ""in case of fire or big move"" trunk.

So I filled it up pretty quick and after a day through my /r/neckbeardnests I was satisfied with my progress and threw out the trash and shoved the trunk somewhere.

Good while later I had made token progress but all the new ""sentimental"" items were in a pile and I needed to stick to my one trunk rule™.  I thought it would be hard to make cuts but actually became super easy.

It was laughable that only a few months ago I couldn't bring myself to recycle a piece of styrofoam because it was on my shelf for years. A comically antiquated calculator that I thought one day I'd use for a gag. 10 year old laptops and dollar store items that I used in maybe Middle school?

Attachment was still there but, of all the cuts, I only remembered the first one listed and the others took a while to think of for this post. I don't miss 'em.

"I want to get rid of all my cupboards’ doors, am I crazy?","I feel like if I don’t see what’s inside my cupboards, I’ll be more inclined to accumulate clutter again. So I only want ""open"" furniture/shelves etc.

I KonMari’d my flat before I moved out last summer and it’s made my life in my new flat way more pleasant. I have less closet space (but I have a cellar) but I like it because it encourages me to think twice about acquiring new things.

I have one cupboard above my toilet seat, one in my bathroom above the heater and a whole wall covered in them in my kitchen.

I’m thinking of getting rid of the one in the toilet altogether because the room is very small already and I think one small shelf above would make it feel less crowded.

I’m torn about the one in the bathroom because it has inbuilt hanging rods where I can put my towel to dry since it’s right in front of the heater. But I feel like taking out the doors would make it easier for me to know what I have, so I avoid buying more soaps when I have 2 bars left in the cupboard already...

I can’t redo the entire kitchen since I’m renting but just taking out the doors on the upper cupboards is just about 4 screws each and they can be put back in quite quickly when I leave (I’m planning to stay in that flat for 3 years at least and I hope to renew the lease for another 3 after that). And I can store them in my cellar in the meantime.

Is that a crazy idea? I’m really tired of going grocery shopping and buying something I already had because I didn’t check the right cupboard and not buying something I needed because I assumed it was in another cupboard...

100 item declutter and lessons learned,"I just completed a 100 item declutter. Actually there were more than 100 items total, but I grouped some things together. 100 doesn't put a big dent in my hoard and many of these first things were easier emotionally to declutter, so I definitely have a lot more work to do. But I learned some valuable things about myself in the process.

I have hoarding tendencies. I keep things I don't use because what if. I also keep things I don't intend to use, usually because I feel bad that I've wasted my money. I avoid the bad feeling of being wasteful by putting it in a drawer and telling myself that maybe I'll use it one day. I keep things because my fantasy self would use them. I have tons of painting supplies that I hope to use someday, but I likely won't. I have boxes of yarn that I want to knit someday. I have a very nice stand mixer that I used once 7 years ago. 

I collect consumable beauty items like makeup, nail polish, and skincare. I have an entire drawer in my bathroom of beauty-related samples. In fact, I also have stashes of samples in multiple areas of my house. This is even after I decluttered a huge bag of samples I didn't want. I have more beauty stuff than I could possibly use over my lifetime. I keep the things I don't use until past their expiry date. I then have a good reason to get rid of them and don't have to feel as guilty. I still feel guilty though. I still look at the stacks of stuff and feel bad.

What I learned: I have to stop buying things in bulk. They expire before I get to them. Often I get sick of using that thing and wish it was used up so I could try something new. Giant bottles of conditioner look shitty and take up too much space in my shower. My cupboards are full of backups and backups of backups. What will happen if I run out of bodywash? I might have to pay full price? Better buy 8 bottles now while it's on sale. So what if my cabinet barely closes? Ugh. 
I'm not saving much money anyway when I don't even finish the thing and have to throw it out.

I buy something to replace an item that is worn out or I no longer want, but I still keep the item I was supposed to discard!! I do this mainly with clothes and shoes. I recently bought a new pair of black ankle boots to replace the pair that I hated. I bought a new pair because they were comfortable and beautiful. I kept the old pair too that were uncomfortable and kind of ugly. Why??

I get an emotional payoff from knowing something is there if I want it. I do this with food a lot. For example, I'll buy a box of crackers and share a certain amount with my husband. Then I will start to feel like I'm not getting my share, so I'll declare that the rest are mine and put the box in my designated spot. It will sit there for weeks. Then it will go stale and I'll throw it out.

I'm on mat leave now so I'm home all day. I'm confronted with my stuff all the time and I hate it. It's so depressing. I take my baby out to the mall for half the day to avoid my mess. Then I buy new things and add to it. What am I doing?

So I'm starting to get rid of it. I'm not doing it as quickly as I'd like and I'm still making excuses to keep certain things, but it's a start.

Here is what I decluttered and why.

Actually there were more than 100 items total, but I grouped some things together. 100 doesn't put a big dent in my hoard and many of these first things were easier emotionally to declutter, so I definitely have a lot more work to do. But I learned some valuable things about myself in the process.

I have hoarding tendencies. I keep things I don't use because what if. I also keep things I don't intend to use, usually because I feel bad that I've wasted my money. I avoid the bad feeling of being wasteful by putting it in a drawer and telling myself that maybe I'll use it one day. I keep things because my fantasy self would use them. I have tons of painting supplies that I hope to use someday, but I likely won't. I have boxes of yarn that I want to knit someday. I have a very nice stand mixer that I used once 7 years ago. 

I collect consumable beauty items like makeup, nail polish, and skincare. I have an entire drawer in my bathroom of beauty-related samples. In fact, I also have stashes of samples in multiple areas of my house. This is even after I decluttered a huge bag of samples I didn't want. I have more beauty stuff than I could possibly use over my lifetime. I keep the things I don't use until past their expiry date. I then have a good reason to get rid of them and don't have to feel as guilty. I still feel guilty though. I still look at the stacks of stuff and feel bad.

What I learned: I have to stop buying things in bulk. They expire before I get to them. Often I get sick of using that thing and wish it was used up so I could try something new. Giant bottles of conditioner look shitty and take up too much space in my shower. My cupboards are full of backups and backups of backups. What will happen if I run out of bodywash? I might have to pay full price? Better buy 8 bottles now while it's on sale. So what if my cabinet barely closes? Ugh. 
I'm not saving much money anyway when I don't even finish the thing and have to throw it out.

I buy something to replace an item that is worn out or I no longer want, but I still keep the item I was supposed to discard!! I do this mainly with clothes and shoes. I recently bought a new pair of black ankle boots to replace the pair that I hated. I bought a new pair because they were comfortable and beautiful. I kept the old pair too that were uncomfortable and kind of ugly. Why??

I get an emotional payoff from knowing something is there if I want it. I do this with food a lot. For example, I'll buy a box of crackers and share a certain amount with my husband. Then I will start to feel like I'm not getting my share, so I'll declare that the rest are mine and put the box in my designated spot. It will sit there for weeks. Then it will go stale and I'll throw it out.

I'm on mat leave now so I'm home all day. I'm confronted with my stuff all the time and I hate it. It's so depressing. I take my baby out to the mall for half the day to avoid my mess. Then I buy new things and add to it. What am I doing?

So I'm starting to get rid of it. I'm not doing it as quickly as I'd like and I'm still making excuses to keep certain things, but it's a start.

Here is what I decluttered and why.

Decluttering (and organizing) my office area,"Office work is slowing down in the last half of December as most clients and sales people are off doing the company holiday gift exchanging and having lots of various lunch meetings and so forth.

So I've tasked myself with clearing out a lot of untouched paperwork that's been building up around me.  None of which is mine, but it got shifted into my area because some desks and filing cabinets needed to be cleared off.

This year, the oldest paperwork I'm finding is from 2000.

That was 18 years ago.  That was before I even got into this industry!  (I didn't start university until 2001.)

I'm dumping it all.  Not even bothering asking my boss.  Because seriously, there's no reason for any of it to still be here.

"Breaking Point ""Living in your storage unit""","Tl;Dr : Sharing a 2 BR- most of the clutter is in my closed bedroom. A little clutter in the rest of the house. Been making progress. Roommate said his thoughts very bluntly and I really need some words of encouragement. 


I currently live with my ex boyfriend, we broke up a year ago but stayed ""friends"" and thought sharing a 2 BR townhouse after moving out of a larger 4-5 roommate house would be a good plan, as we knew how to co-habitate.

He's been unbelievably cold, distant with me since moving into the new place. I've been trying really hard to get his help making the place ""ours"" and comfortable.

My bedroom is still box-city from having to put a craft room and garage workshop in it. I've basically been ignoring the monster and sleeping in the corner.  The main part of the house, however- is by and in large very open.

I've asked his help (Very reasonably) to help with small tasks such as organizing the spice cabinet, helping hang up pictures, rearranging furniture etc. He's not been involved, instead he comes home- everyday, cooks a frozen pizza and plays hours of video games in the living room and goes to bed.

Today the breaking point was realizing that he refuses to say hello to me, refuses to ever talk to me, refuses to make eye contact.

I texted him asking to please just tell me what I'm doing wrong.

""""How have you been taking my needs into account? You do this while I'm at work. I've been living in your storage unit. And there were actual months when you weren't listening to anything I said. I'm not doing this right now. I have a job to do. Stop making that harder""

Firstly- yeah I shouldn't text him at work, but he's always busy raiding in video games when he's home. Secondly and the reason I posted 

""I've been living in your storage unit""

That line makes me want to shoot myself in the head. (Yes I have a therapist and meds)

I've been battling the tower of mess for years- I've been trying. The last few months I've gotten rid of a huge amount of trash, Goodwill, etc. But there's still more..

This is the first time he's ever expressed a frustration with my ""stuff"" and he certainly did said it bluntly.

I'm going to try extremely hard to use this deep deep hurt to be a catalyst. But - I could seriously use a little bit of kindness or encouragement. This exact moment the only thing I'm feeling is pain. I feel like the mess &gt; me. I feel like I've created an unliveable space. I feel un-loveable.

I'm going to try extremely hard to use this deep deep hurt to be a catalyst. But - I could seriously use a little bit of kindness or encouragement. This exact moment the only thing I'm feeling is pain. I feel like the mess &gt; me. I feel like I've created an unliveable space. I feel un-loveable.

How do you declutter with a spouse that is a bit of a pack rat?,"Sorry guys, rant incoming, really need to get this off my chest, you don’t need to read this or upvote or comment or anything. 


My husband and I bought our home 4 years ago and it’s been a disaster ever since. My dreams of a beautiful, nicely decorated, tidy home like I grew up in were dashed. I feel like I live in a frat house. My husband is the absolute light of my life and I would do literally anything for him, but he can’t wrap his mind around why I hate our house and why I get so incredibly overwhelmed when I try to tackle any mess. 

He loves stuff. Especially chairs. There are fucking chairs all over the house. There’s at least ten in the living room, three in the kitchen, three in our bedroom plus a couch. Doesn’t matter what kind of chairs, but he prefers rolling office chairs. So we have six rolling office chairs in our living room. Our living room used to have gorgeous hardwood floors but all the chairs he’s brought home over the years have scratched them all to hell. Not to mention he and his friends will just drag the recliners around. I tried felt furniture pads but they constantly fall off for some reason and they obviously don’t work on the rolling chairs. I’ve asked him to sell or trash the rolling chairs and even put them out for him in the garage but he just brought them back in. When I asked why he said we need chairs for d&amp;d. We have three people come over once a week for four hours, why do we need so many chairs all the time?! Why can’t we use easily folded and stored chairs? 

There’s also a pile of pillows the dogs have been laying on that used to be the back cushions of our couch we threw away. I put them on the curb to be picked up with the couch and he brought them back in. When I asked why he said they were good cushions, the dogs could lie on them, and we could use them someday. They’re not nice cushions, the dogs have a dog bed, and we’ve already agreed we’re not getting a couch like the last one ever again so the cushions won’t go with whatever we get next. 

Then there’s the STUFF. His best friend is constantly bringing us “gifts” and at first it was endearing, but now it’s really annoying and even upsetting because it’s almost always junk. So there’s just useless junk everywhere. I throw away most of it, but my husband won’t let me throw away everything, so we have all these stupid kitschy, tacky things everywhere. I’m very minimalistic, having a bunch of stuff stresses me out, to the point where I get paralyzingly overwhelmed when I have to do a thorough cleaning, which is frequently as we’re a multi-pet home so dust, dander, and hair require very regular cleaning. 

Also, books. I love books. I love to read. I’ve held on to books, sure, but only really good books that mean something to me and I want to read again. My husband on the other hand is the opposite. He wants all the books. He says they make us look well read. We don’t need to look well read, we are well read, and anyone who knows us is aware of that. There are books in our bookshelves that he CANT read because they’re in fucking Russian and Spanish. There are so many books in there he’s never read and will never read, but he won’t throw any of them away. So our bookshelves are packed three rows deep on every shelf. On the other bookshelf is boardgames. Fine, I love boardgames, they’re great when you have company. But he has games that he admits are terrible and doesn’t want to play again but he doesn’t want to get rid of them. We even have a closet in our entry hall that would be perfect to store boardgames. I did manage to convince him to put part of his MTG collection in there. When I ask him why we need so many games he says he wants to teach our kids boardgames. That’s super sweet! But we’re not having kids for like, eight more years and then you have to wait several more before they start being able to play boardgames. Then there’s more kitschy bullshit stacked on top of the bookshelves. 

He just doesn’t throw anything away. Office supplies, craft supplies, old prescriptions, boxes our phones, watches, and computer parts came in, wires, cables, old blankets that are beyond repair, chairs, cups he got at gas stations, the list goes on and on. 

I’ve talked to him several times about it and he always promises we’ll do a clean up, and then a perfect day to clean up and declutter will get here and he won’t let me get rid of anything! After four years of this I’ve just about given up. I don’t let any of my friends or family come over. I’m really worried about how far this is going to go. He keeps saying it won’t be a problem when we get a bigger house and have more storage, but we aren’t going to be able to afford a new house for at least five more years.

100 item declutter challenge: easier than I thought,"Yesterday my partner and I searched our home for 100 items we could get rid of. At first we thought it was going to be a very daunting task.

How do I organize my cable mess with zip-ties if its components are volatile?,"# Problem

I have about 15 electrical adapters for external hard-disks next to my main PC and naturally this results in a mess of cables. They aren't even behind my PC either (no space); they are next to my PC, a visible, messy mess of cables. The evident solution would be to use zip-ties to bundle some of them together - and I've done that - but there is now a problem: I regularly move around most of those hard disks. 

Each time I need a hard-disk, I need to cut the zip-tie open and when I put the hard-disk back after use, I need to get a new zip-tie and tie it back up. The obvious problem here is the type of zip-tie; the ones I use are those that irreversibly close shut after applying them. 

Note: *The reason why I have external hard-disks as opposed to internal ones is because they are much cheaper than the latter, but the compromise is that they have to use their own power source.*

&amp;#x200B;

How do I solve this problem?

# Possible solutions

* a) Use those zip-ties that aren't permanent - the ones that have velcro strips. I see that as being a feasible solution because then I could go ahead and open up those zip-ties whenever I need the disks. Then, when I need to place the disks back next to my PC, I can just put them back into the zip-ties.
   * pros: flexibility
   * cons: constant fiddling
* b) Use a harddisk server
   * pros: permanent
   * cons: cost of electricity; inflexibility
* c) Get a drobo NAS 
   * pros: permanent
   * cons: cost of electricity

Something to think about. I think solution a) is great for now. Otherwise I need to think about optimizing this mess, either through diminishing cable visibility or something else.",declutter,1545060389,Je_pense_je_suis,36,1,True,a70qbp,2018-12-17,"How do I organize my cable mess with zip-ties if its components are volatile? # Problem

Amazon list declutter,"In an effort to curb my online shopping habit, I started several Amazon lists a few years ago. Several hundred items on each. One for makeup, skincare.

Depression based consumerism?,"Back in 2009 was around the time I started having a full time work with adequate pay, unfortunately I had no sense of responsibility and ashamed to say I had no concept of saving and just spent most of the disposable income I had, started to get myself sorted at the start of this year and now my past casts a long shadow on me still.

I also decided to delete my Goodreads account and have drastically cut my Instagram following/followers...I may delete it altogether. I haven't had Facebook in months.  


Tonight I am returning 2 bag of things I haven't used to Target and another bag to Bath and Body Works.

Once the table looked pretty, it has never had anything else added except my reading glasses case as that seems to be the easiest place to always find it when I want to put the glasses in to go in my bag.

This may sound cluttery to some, but it works for me.  It is under the window at right angles to where I sit, not in the middle of the room.",0

Selling vs. Donating,"I recently bought a house and my SO and I moved into it less than two months ago. We hired movers for the big items but we transported all of our clothes, shoes, misc items ourselves via our personal cars (yes it took multiple trips. It's a 30 mile drive from old place to new place). I realized during this grueling time that I have WAY more crap than I originally thought. I purged a lot of it (trash or donated) during the moving process, but I also kept a lot of it because I think it's a waste to donate it. More specifically, I have  Disney and Star Wars items that are in great condition that I don't want anymore but would be too much of a waste to straight up donate. For ex. I have a Star Wars Itty Bitty collection / Disney Thomas Kinkade puzzle collection / Disneyland popcorn bucket collection / Star Wars coloring books and cookbooks, etc. 

I am in the process of listing them up on eBay and I am slowllllyyyy getting rid of them. But the fact is, there's still a huge pile that I have. I feel like not having it there would clear up my mind, but it takes a long time to actually sell everything. 

Long story short: is it worth it to sell each item slowly over time for a small profit or should I cut my losses and donate.

Making progress!,"I've finally gotten started on my bedroom. I haven't seen the floor in a really long time and, while I still can't really see the floor, I can almost walk from my bed to the closet.

I've bagged up most of the clothes that aren't hanging or folded and am going to wash and sort through them this weekend. I have two large, black trash bags of clothing (which is almost half or what I own) and two laundry bags full of clothes. Anything not in the bags or the bin of sweaters I have will probably get pitched since I am slightly disgusted by the thought of touching clothing that hasn't been washed or seen in so long. It's mainly socks and underwear with a few pairs of worn Jean's. Nothing too important to me.

I'm also turning in my old uniform shirts tomorrow, which will eliminate a good chunk of clothing in my room.

I'm feeling motivated enough to tackle some of the trash on the floor. Mainly boxes that will go out for recycling and water bottles.

I am, however, stumped on where to store the clothing while I tidy up the rest of my room. I was going to pile the bags in my laundry room, but CPS will be stopping by my house in the morning tomorrow to make sure the house is in good enough shape for my underaged family member to stay here and I know that the bags will give the social worker a bad impression. We have a sun porch that I was considering putting them on for now since they won't be confused with the regular trash since we use white trash bags for garbage.

Baby steps add up,"I was working on my wall of boxes today and I managed to dispose of 5 larger things I didn't really need, a box of other smaller things, and emptied 5 crates by consolidating ""keep"" boxes or putting it where it belonged.

I did some figuring the other day, and in total, doing small bits at a time as I have time and energy, over the past 11 months I've managed to get rid of 22 boxes/crates of clutter, bags and bags of garbage (lost count, but I know of 4 black garbage bags) and 4 pieces of furniture I had picked up by the dumpster and had no room for.

My next project is to get an armoire and get rid of the crates and plastic drawers and the old, raggy dresser I have most of my clothes in. The crates, which are stackable as a wall unit, will be reused to hold my craft and gardening supplies that are packed away in boxes now, so more boxes gone and everything organized.

After that, the next project is to put up shelves (using the shelving and brackets I've been hoarding) on the walls to hold all my colorful baskets and plastic shoeboxes of miscellaneous things, all tagged neatly so I can find things when I need them. That will mostly clean out the linen closet so I can actually put my linens in there.

Where to donate old referee uniforms?,"This may be pretty niche, hopefully someone can help.

TLDR: many soccer refs will have old jerseys that can't be used anymore because there is a new style we need to have. Looking for a place they can be donated (local drop-off preferred, long distance may work). Located in NJ.

Starting in 2019 all soccer referees in at least most soccer leagues will need new uniforms (which started being distributed a couple of years ago). I get why it's happening, since some refs had been wearing styles that were very old and it looked mismatched and dated. But now there will be many refs who have jerseys they can't wear anymore, and it's not like an old t-shirt you can wear around.

I'd like to send my jerseys (and maybe others if I can get more refs in my area interested) somewhere they will be used.

My parents are hoarders.,"It's hard for me to visit and see all of the spaces filled with stuff. They have a double carspace sized shed, an under house section and a whole house filled with stuff. My parents have always had a hard time decluttering things but the worst of it was when my maternal grandmother died in 2010. Most of her possessions now live in the garage. Talking with my parents about it doesn't work. They are both ""it could be useful"" types but my mum is also a ""it's got sentimental value/it could be worth a lot!"" type of hoarder. Not a great mix. I say all of this because I know some of you have seen the struggle with your own family members and it's so tough to know that they could be enjoying their space so much more without all the stuff. 

Here is how I help - 

* I offer to help clean the house

* I take away my contributions to the clutter

* I encourage decluttering where possible when I can

Cleaning means I can move around the stuff and find the actualy garbage but also throw away things I know they won't miss and won't use. Eg. Stickers for school books when they're youngest child is in her mid twenties. I don't throw anything of value or that they may want but I'm more ruthless about things they definitely won't use or need. Taking the brunt of cleaning (vacuuming, mopping, deep cleaning walls) gives them a nicer space to go through some things too. 

I have some childhood crap stuffed away in my old room and other places. Every time I visit I take another box away to my own cluttered home to go through and donate/throw/keep. It's easier both for me and for them that these things slowly disappear. 

For Christmas this year I have given dad my time and effort. I asked if he had any projects in mind that he wanted to do and I would be on board to help him. He got very excited because he wants to go through the shed/garage so he can fit cars in there. I'm hopeful we can declutter some things but I doubt that will be the case due to it being my mum's decision but at least we will be working towards a better space.

Decluttering bath products: using them up vs. throwing away,"I am trying to declutter and simplify some things in my life while I'm on winter break. One thing I'm stalled on is bath products... Many of these I only partially used because they stopped working for me, or I didn't like the smell, or I discovered something shiny and new.

Even stuff with homes...,"(a specific place to put the item every time I use it) eventually becomes part of the clutter when other junk occupies its home!

My problem is exacerbated when I try to clean up. I pick up an item, go to put it away, and find stuff in that spot. So I’m standing there, with an item in my hand, trying to figure out what to do with it while I try to clear it’s home. I know if I put it down, it’s becomes part of the clutter, but someplace else. 

But what do I do. Put it “near” its home? And do I clear of its home next, or do I go back to the area I started cleaning, even though the item I moved didn’t make it home? That violates two of the unclutter your your home tenets. If you pick it up, put it away; don’t put it down someplace else. Also, finish what you start, and you’ll feel the accomplishment.

"The truth about ""Just in case.""","I used to own thousands of books, LPs, CDs, DVDs, clothes, makeup, and papers. Well, I still own thousands. But I've gotten rid of thousands, too, and I get rid of hundreds more every time I declutter. 

For up to 20 years, I was holding onto those things ""just in case."" 

""Just in case"" I want to read this book again. ""Just in case"" I need another formal dress. ""Just in case"" I can make some money selling this. ""Just in case"" I need a last-minute gift. ""Just in case"" my family member passes, and I want to remember all the birthday cards they sent me. ""Just in case"" the internet's out and I want to watch a movie. ""Just in case"" I find the matching saucer to this cup at a thrift store one day. ""Just in case"" someone comes over, and will think I'm cool for owning this band's LP (nevermind that my borderline-hoarding means I never invite friends over).

Anxious people like me often have problems with clutter/hoarding. We are living in a fearful state, surrounding ourselves with items to prevent vague potential future emergencies.

This is not how happy people live. Happy people live in the now. Happy people know that they can deal with needs when they arise. Happy people define themselves by their character and their relationships, not by their stuff.

I decided to join the happy people, and started to declutter. 

My progress is sporadic. I do a lazy version of KonMari sometimes. Mostly I just toss. I can't be bothered to sell. I have stuff I held onto for 10 years because I ""intended to sell it."" That intention keeps me stuck, so I tossed it too.

I give my stuff away. Books to the library and the literacy program I volunteer at. Furniture and LPs on the sidewalk with a Craigslist curb alert. Recycling a billion old papers. Makeup and clothes go to friends, to the women's shelter, in the trash when necessary. CDs donated to a neighbor's garage sale. I just need it gone.

I get a weird euphoria as I do this. A physical sense of calm comes over me, a relaxation in my muscles. The only other time I get that feeling is when I'm praying or meditating. Sometimes I think that sense of calm is what you get when you let go and trust the universe to provide for your needs. I can't explain it, but it leads me to believe I'm doing the right thing.

Of all the thousands of things I let go, I can barely remember any. One vintage dress sticks in my mind, but it barely fit me when I bought it, and only got more ill-fitting as the years went on. I pictured it as the perfect dress, but when I pulled it out of its storage bin, it was brittle and yellowed, too old to be of good use to anyone. I should have let it go sooner, let someone else enjoyed its last few years. Lesson learned — I tossed it with conviction.

I can recall several books, but I don't especially miss any. One personal finance book I thought, ""hm, I should have kept that."" But if I want it, I can go buy it again for $12.

What an incredibly small price that is, compared to the burden of keeping THOUSANDS of books! I let them all go, I gained space, I lost stress, shame, dust, and clutter — and the total ""cost"" to me is one 12-dollar book that I might need to buy back. It blows my mind to realize I gave up so much peace of mind to save 12 bucks.

The truth is, for most things, their ""just in case"" moment never comes. All those items we keep, thinking maybe someday, if things get dire enough, they'll have their chance to shine. But that's so pessimistic — when I hoard, I'm betting on things going bad!

I'm trying to think differently — to imagine a life where calamities are not waiting around every corner. Where I don't need the ""armor"" of all this stuff. Where I trust the world, and myself to deal with it. Where I know it's worth letting things go, and trusting that the things I need will be there when I need them.

How I Decluttered My Papers,"I finally decluttered my papers. I thought I'd previously decluttered papers. Nope. I'd just been meticulously filing them away, thinking every scrap of paper was important, and just making my life a nightmare. Anyway, we're moving in two months so I decided I needed declutter properly. This is what I did and I hope it helps someone else.

* Gathered all the papers from around the house (including my husband's) and put them all on the coffee table. 

* Thought ""F******ck. I hate past me.""

* Decided that weighing the papers before and after decluttering would give me a good idea of how much I'd gotten rid of. Weighed &gt; 60 kg (&gt;132 pounds).

* Thought ""that's more than I weigh. Oh god.""

* Decided to give myself 5 days to get through it all (I've been off sick from work and not able to move around so much, so decluttering papers was the perfect activity but still exhausting for me).

* Decided what type of papers I needed to keep BEFORE looking at the papers in front of me (including asking my husband what types of papers he wanted to keep). I really think this was the most important step because it helped me focus. I also decided that, instead of having my usual 20 piles (trash, recycle, shred, and then 17 categories of filing), I'd have 6 piles (trash, recycle, shred, husband's papers for him to look through, keep to scan and then destroy hard copies, keep hard copies). My goal was to get rid of 90% of the papers (ie. 54kg or 119 pounds).

* I divided the papers into 5 relatively even piles and then tackled pile 1 on day 1, pile 2 on day 2, etc. When I felt like I needed a break (usually every 30-45 minutes), I'd go and trash/recycle/shred the papers I'd already sorted, get husband to sort his pile of papers, and then go take a break for 30 minutes.

* As I worked, I repeated the following phrase to myself: ""When everything is important, nothing is.""

* When it was finally all done, I expounded endlessly to husband that ""I did it! I DID IT! Moving is going to be so much easier!"" I may have also gotten upset with him when he brought a receipt into the house and didn't deal with it immediately.

* Weighed the papers. 5.5kg (12 pounds). Drank some wine to celebrate.

* Looked up the value of all the lottery tickets I found. $300! Then realized that my husband spent more than $300 to purchase all those tickets (there were 12).


What I've learned:

* Shredding papers is cathartic and a great way to keep a toddler entertained.

* Lottery tickets can be claimed up to 6 or 7 years after the lottery date in several states in Australia. The oldest lottery ticket I found was from 2014.

* A lot of people have not updated their mailing addresses or else they really just want us to get their mail. I had to make a 7th pile just for all the mail for other people so I could return to sender.

* Most importantly, the average person does not need to keep nearly as many papers as they think.


What I've changed:

* I deal with a scrap of paper as soon as I touch it. Needed to print, sign, scan, and email back a document? Great, as soon as it's scanned, I shred the hard copy. Mail gets recycled or trashed into bins before I get in the house, important mail gets dealt with when I walk in the front door. Receipts get trashed when I get home and unpack purchases. I plan on sticking with this because I never again want to spend 5 days of life sorting paper!
",declutter,1543883948,GetMotivatedNow,33,1,True,a2v6bt,2018-12-03,"How I Decluttered My Papers I finally decluttered my papers. I thought I'd previously decluttered papers. Nope. I'd just been meticulously filing them away, thinking every scrap of paper was important, and just making my life a nightmare. Anyway, we're moving in two months so I decided I needed declutter properly. This is what I did and I hope it helps someone else.

* Gathered all the papers from around the house (including my husband's) and put them all on the coffee table. 

* Thought ""F******ck. I hate past me.""

* Decided that weighing the papers before and after decluttering would give me a good idea of how much I'd gotten rid of. Weighed &gt; 60 kg (&gt;132 pounds).

* Thought ""that's more than I weigh. Oh god.""

* Decided to give myself 5 days to get through it all (I've been off sick from work and not able to move around so much, so decluttering papers was the perfect activity but still exhausting for me).

* Decided what type of papers I needed to keep BEFORE looking at the papers in front of me (including asking my husband what types of papers he wanted to keep). I really think this was the most important step because it helped me focus. I also decided that, instead of having my usual 20 piles (trash, recycle, shred, and then 17 categories of filing), I'd have 6 piles (trash, recycle, shred, husband's papers for him to look through, keep to scan and then destroy hard copies, keep hard copies). My goal was to get rid of 90% of the papers (ie. 54kg or 119 pounds).

* I divided the papers into 5 relatively even piles and then tackled pile 1 on day 1, pile 2 on day 2, etc. When I felt like I needed a break (usually every 30-45 minutes), I'd go and trash/recycle/shred the papers I'd already sorted, get husband to sort his pile of papers, and then go take a break for 30 minutes.

Saying no to holiday gifts,"Christmas is the big holiday in my family, and we have traditionally gone all-out with gifts. I’m at the point now where I’ve decluttered quite a bit and gotten rid of a ton of crap. How do I politely and firmly tell my family I don’t want a lot of gifts?

Help my decluttering was interfered with.,"You guys know that decluttering is something that accumulates and has other dimensions form logistical to physical to emotional/phsuchological. 

In my situation I had to live with my mom dude to financial reasons for a health treatment. However I always knew I’d eventually leave. And that thenpkaces id most likely move would have extreme weather so I kept my clothes stored, and gradually sorted them out from extremity of weathe, practicality, use, wear and tear. 

I separated into suitcases and boxes, clean and folded, what was to be ready for packing. Then donating, recycling and what was ready for the garbage. Which was all neatly stored in a separate room away from the smell of her cigar food and dog pee. 

I will finally be able to move soon, and had to make short trips abroad to sort paperwork etc. In these trips my mother had the impulsive and brilliant idea to grab all I had sorted, folded, separated and mix it all and put it back in into boxes. After a very stressful trip for moving abroad which entails stressful paper work and physical exhaustion form carrying furniture etc I am received with all of my things in plain sight in the living room in boxes.

It’s all mixed now. Underwear with leather jackets, blouses, dresses, shoes, sweatpants, purses, even random objects like glass jars etc. All wrinkled and mixed with what was clean and folded, what was to be donated and thrown, what was no longer usable and unclean and to be thrown to the garbage. All of this into random swirls or things into dusty boxes. 

What took me months destroyed in a day. Withought my knowledge or consent. I can barely look at it, I feel so frustrated because now i have less than a month to do what took me months.

Weatherproof container for long-term storage?,"I really want to declutter my room but I can't throw away everything so I'm looking to put like half of the stuff into long-term storage.

* UV/high-temperature proof (important): The container will be outdoor exposed to the element and the sun is pretty serious where I live during summer. I've actually had a bad experience where my childhood toys were stored in a clear plastic box in said outdoor area temporarily when I was younger while the apartment is being renovated for a couple weeks and they melted when we brought them in again :(

* Size: Width and depth is not an issue but apparently storage units can't be too tall in mentioned outdoor area or it would violate building code for some bullshit reason (long story) so I'm looking for containers that are waist high.

* pantry stocks that aren't new (for example: a protein shake, some nooch, assorted seeds and nuts, polenta flour)
* perfume samples
* old skincare (I just don't like it anymore but my feet and hands are going to get PAMPERED)

I feel pretty confident in hitting a lot of full pans on these.

The hidden cost of reselling,"So you've successfully decluttered. You have a nice pile of trash ready to go out, a pile of stuff that you need to take to where they belong and a bunch of stuff that you really liked, but you really want to sell.

Then comes the real work. You snap a pic on your phone. You drop it onto offerup or Facebook Marketplace, or your local buy/sell and wait. Meanwhile, you take out your trash, you sort down your stuff to its rightful home and you're stuck with a bunch of stuff just sitting in a corner waiting.

You get a message, three days later, someone wants to buy it! But they ghost you. So you have to relist it. And start another awkward conversation with a random stranger who wants this 1960's vintage knickknack you've been holding onto.

At first, one item doesn't seem so bad, it's just an investment in time. But if you try to sell your entire pile of sell-able items you end up spending a lot of time categorizing, picturing, waiting, setting up calls. It can really become more of a time-sink than you realize!

Soft toys - where to take them? (UK),"I have so many cuddly toys from when I was little. There's still a crate I'm keeping, but I've halved its contents in this latest purge. I absolutely can't bear to throw them in the bin. I can accept no longer owning them, I can't accept treating them like the rest of the filth in the bin.

Problem is there's nowhere to donate them. They're not broken or disgusting (all have been through the washing machine and kept in a plastic crate in my bedroom since) but they are clearly pre-owned and pre-loved. Which means that the charity shops won't take them and the collections for kids in poverty won't take them (only accepting ""new or like new"" toys - I already gave them everything that fit the bill).

Problem is there's nowhere to donate them. They're not broken or disgusting (all have been through the washing machine and kept in a plastic crate in my bedroom since) but they are clearly pre-owned and pre-loved.

Moving in 3 Months,"24F preparing for a short distance move with my husband. Every time we've moved before (and it's not been a small number of times) we've said ""this is it!

"Update: From garbage bags to vacuum bags, and why I love y’all for suggesting this solution.","My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/9s8c09/need_help_how_to_store_20_huge_garbage_bags_of/?st=JO8PKNJ0&amp;sh=d5a8383b) for reference.

Sorting through 20+ massive bags of an incarcerated family member’s personal belongings is an emotional ordeal, let’s just start there. It gives you a window into the person’s life and you learn more than you ever wanted to know about their problems. It had to be done, though, because there were items in the bags that would attract bugs and we didn’t have enough room to store that many huge bags.

Y’all suggested a combination of vacuum-sealed bags and plastic bins and I’m here to tell you it worked! It took me a solid week because I had to wash a LOT of clothing and linens, and heaven knows the clothes will come out wrinkled in spite of my Kon Mari ninja folding skills, but it is condensed to the point that it takes up only one bedroom closet. No risk of damage from being stored in the attic or outside! 

Here’s how it went down:

- I read some online reviews and still couldn’t decide which bags to buy, so I finally went to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond because they have a liberal return policy. Using coupons, I bought 3 boxes of L and XL Ziplock brand vacuum bags. The L is about the size of the bag that a king size comforter set comes in. The XL is massive. 

- I also bought two from Dollar Tree just to test them out. They are much smaller and more suitable for packing away winter blankets and such, but the quality is decent. I’d definitely use them for packing clothes in suitcases the next time we travel.

- I washed and folded everything, grouping like items together. We don’t know when the person will be released so I wanted to have winter clothes separate from summer clothes, for example. Kon Mari folding techniques kept the size/shape of the stacks consistent.  

- Stuffing the bags with stacks of folded clothes is a pain! At the tail end of the project I realized it was better to stand the bag vertically and stuff it from the bottom up. Gravity is your friend! 

- Once filled and sealed, I used my label-maker to make labels for each bag. They are see-through but since I won’t be the one opening the bags I thought it was best to make sure they could tell at a glance what all is inside in case items were too bunched up to tell from just looking.

- I originally thought I’d have to then put the bags into plastic bins to store in the shed, but they are so compact I was able to stack them in a bedroom closet despite the fact that they are a little wobbly because they aren’t perfect cubes.

All told, I spent less than $75 on bags and I only had to buy a couple of bins to hold toiletries and stuff. 

THANK YOU to everyone who pointed me in the right direction. That was a stressful day and I can’t tell you how much better I felt once I had a viable solution.

Does Anyone Else Feel Like They Are In A Constant State of Decluttering?,"To me it feels like I'm always getting rid of stuff and decluttering. And it's not really because we are bringing new stuff into the house and not getting rid of old stuff. In fact, my decluttering habits have left me now with four empty 18 gallon storage tubs and several smaller storage tubs, which is kind of nice.

What generally happens is I'll be looking for something. I'll get into an area that I've decluttered before (and nothing really has been added) and I'll look at the items there and go ""You know what, I don't think I really need this anymore"" and get rid of it. All of these being items that I previously kept for one reason or another and survived previous purges.

But it seems like I'm constantly doing this. I'm not sure if I just need to stop myself from doing this on a constant basis and just restrain myself into to doing like a quarterly purge or if I should just keep at it.

I do recognize that my dad and sister were hoarders and some of their philosophies rubbed off on me so I tend to keep things that maybe I should just toss. But the fact that they were hoarders is also what tends to instill the 'I don't need this, I'm tossing it' mentality that sends me into a constant decluttering mode.

I just decluttered my master bath.,"Quick picture painting for you: we live in a 1,000 sq ft duplex. 2 adults, 2 children under 4, a medium sized dog, and a big cat (he weighs 20 lbs but is by no means a fat cat). Our place has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, the master bath includes the laundry. 

I just spent almost THREE HOURS cleaning and decluttering the shit out of our master bathroom. This does NOT include the laundry section of our bathroom. Literally just the (one) sink and counter area, the cabinet and two drawers underneath it, and our “medicine cabinet” behind the mirror above the sink.

I intended on deep cleaning the toilet and the basket of junk on the back of the toilet (aka basket of skin care routines that I never committed to) but by the time I was done with the sink areas, I was done for the night. 

I got rid of an entire garbage bag just from those areas, not including the cleaning supplies I used (mix of clorox wipes and ms Meyers spray combined with paper towels). SO went to bed before I started the process, but I told him I’d leave a [small plastic dollar tree] box of stuff I think he may need, that he can go through himself and decide what to keep and what to toss. 

We are beginning our Kon Mari method, but I’m finding that I can’t even start because our amount of bs has just been allowed to accumulate and sit through two pregnancies over a span of just barely over four years in this place.

"TV/Electronics, Hazmat, Batteries, Oil and other hard to get rid of items...What do you do with them?","I'm having issues getting rid of items because recycling/garbage won't take them and local drop off points won't take them.

I have several TV's, a battery for a riding mower, used cooking oil, and some flares. 

I've tried electronic drop off sites (Sunnking.com has points with Goodwill) but they don't take TV's of any kind. They also don't take batteries. My garbage and recycling contractors hired by my town won't take any of those items mentioned, even cooking oil. Local auto places around me only take used motor oil (I called). 

My town hall doesn't have any solutions (they're the ones that told me to use Sunnking. I called and asked the people there but they just said ""I don't know""

I've looked up electronics recycling places by my area and all of them say ""No Tv's/Monitors of any kind"" 

I understand landfills and how they work so I understand the reasons behind the hazmat laws. I've tried giving the TV's away to friends (FIL had like 10 TV's we repurposed as many as we could when we put him in a nursing home). I've tried charities but Goodwill and others must be full up on TV's because they won't take them either. I pride myself on trying to get rid of things in the most environmentally friendly way. But I'll admit I'm getting frustrated by lack of options and the amount of work I've already put into this when most people simply put things in a bag or drop them in a ditch at this point. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

"How I deal with mail, comments/tips welcome.","Re: dealing with mail.  I hate it and finally just put a big basket by the door where the mail comes in.  Every day I flip through the new mail, just in case something actually time sensitive comes in (very rare) and then throw everything else (junk mail included) in the basket.   I pay bills online once a month and clean out the mail basket at the same time.  

I end up with three piles - junk mail/catalogs/envelopes (biggest) to recycle, monthly statements and maybe two or three pieces of mail I need to do something with.  Usually I can just take care of those right then because I'm already at the computer/have my checkbook handy.    

I don't even try to file anything, I put a rubber band around anything that doesn't get recycled, write the month/year on the top document and then put the bundle in a box.  If I need to find something later, I usually know the timeframe so I just pull the right bundle(s) and flip through them to find what I need.   

It's not the most elegant system but no mail comes into the house until I'm ready to deal with it and I can find what I need when I need it.

"Saving Stuff to Pass On, What to Keep?","I'm having trouble figuring out what to keep and what to let go. If it were up to me I would trash everything. I'm not a particularly sentimental person. However, I feel guilt because I have kids and I keep thinking that maybe they may want these family things someday.

The main issue is photographs. My side of the family has the picture taking gene, and I also have the only grandchild on both sides of the family.  One weekend at my parents house can generate about 400 photos. My parents dutifully copied them all to discs and handed them to me.

What am I supposed to do with all of them? Are my kids really going to want to see a dozen pictures of themselves for every year they were alive? Are my great-grandkids going to want to see more than half a dozen or so of each family relative that they've never met?

And what do I do with the stuff? Do I really need the aircraft parts from my great-grandfather? Do I need pictures that my husband's grandmother purchased in the 60s to hang on the wall? These are all things that my parents and my in-laws have given me because they were sentimental enough not to throw away, but I don't want them. Am I supposed to keep them for my kids?

My grandmother did oil paintings. I have over two dozen oil paintings of things I don't really care about. I mean, who wants to hang a picture of a candle, an apple, and a handkerchief?  But my mom loves them, and wanted me to have them. Never mind that her own house is full of oil paintings as well, and I will inherit those once she passes. Do I really need four dozen oil paintings?

I'm having trouble figuring out what to keep and what to let go. If it were up to me I would trash everything. I'm not a particularly sentimental person. However, I feel guilt because I have kids and I keep thinking that maybe they may want these family things someday.

The main issue is photographs. My side of the family has the picture taking gene, and I also have the only grandchild on both sides of the family.  One weekend at my parents house can generate about 400 photos. My parents dutifully copied them all to discs and handed them to me.

What am I supposed to do with all of them? Are my kids really going to want to see a dozen pictures of themselves for every year they were alive? Are my great-grandkids going to want to see more than half a dozen or so of each family relative that they've never met?

And what do I do with the stuff? Do I really need the aircraft parts from my great-grandfather? Do I need pictures that my husband's grandmother purchased in the 60s to hang on the wall? These are all things that my parents and my in-laws have given me because they were sentimental enough not to throw away, but I don't want them. Am I supposed to keep them for my kids?

My grandmother did oil paintings. I have over two dozen oil paintings of things I don't really care about. I mean, who wants to hang a picture of a candle, an apple, and a handkerchief?  But my mom loves them, and wanted me to have them. Never mind that her own house is full of oil paintings as well, and I will inherit those once she passes. Do I really need four dozen oil paintings?

Pictures,"There's a post here on this subreddit about photos (and other similar things) being passed down to kids and grandkids, etc.

A thought came to me: I've never met my maternal grandpa because he passed when my mom was 18. I've only ever seen one photo of him. And somehow I feel like that's enough, because although a small part of me is interested to see more of his pictures (especially when he was younger), it's not as important as hearing stories about him told by my mom and my mom's sisters (my aunts).

I've also not many photos of my maternal grandma or paternal grandparents (although I've got more of those than my maternal grandpa), but I cherish all of them. I don't have any of their heirlooms either. Yet I have many stories about them. I miss them all so much as they've all gone, and though I don't have many physical things to remind me of them, they're always in my heart and their stories will never be forgotten. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we needn't worry about what to pass on to our kids. A few good photos, a few good heirlooms would be enough.

"A voice of reason is always helpful, especially when you're living together.","I moved in with a long-time friend two months ago, the same one who taught me how to sell on Ebay and whom I now have to thank for giving me a way to purge an absolute fuckton of stuff. Collectibles mostly. (I collect Japanese figures and I was just about drowning in them... Now I've sold off almost everything I had, keeping only a couple of favourites and a specific series that I still collect.)

Before I moved in with her, we'd often talk about the things that we were tempted to buy and the things we had trouble letting go of, and we both found that having someone else to talk to about it helped set us back on track. Sometimes we needed to be discouraged from buying yet another shiny new thing, or one last push to click ""submit listing"" on Ebay, or just to be told we were too attached to this one silly thing we owned. I find it's actually a lot better now that I live with her, though; now I don't have to wait for her response about something (and potentially act on it before she gets back to me), I just ask her when we're home and I get to see her reaction right away. It's been helpful to stop me from acting impulsively and buying things I don't need, because I know if I do it, I'll have to actually face her disappointment and not just read it.

I purged a bunch of stuff both before I moved and after moving here. A big motivation is the fact that I'm in a smaller space (smaller bedroom) and choosing to keep most of my stuff in there rather than all over the apartment. Main reasons for that are that I have a big collection of music as well as band/concert memorabilia, which she's not really into (how someone doesn't even have a favourite band, I'll never know, but it's no big deal to me), and also because my decorating style is ""what colour were the walls again?"" AKA display things EVERYWHERE, which stresses her out. Since she was the one welcoming me into her space, I felt it would be selfish to impose myself on her that way, so I've kept most of my stuff in my room (except a few small things she was OK with me decorating the apartment with). When I first moved I felt like I was choking because of all the boxes, but now they're almost gone and I have some nice furniture to store and display my things in. I do still need shelving for my CDs, though... and frames... a LOT of frames. (Incidentally, does anyone know where to get inexpensive frames for vinyl records/record sleeves?)

We're both constantly looking for things we can get rid of so we can eventually get down to only our absolute favourites. Selling is a bit addicting, I won't lie... The last couple weeks were really good for me on Ebay and now it makes me kinda sad to see I have so many fewer listings up! (MY POKÉMON CARDS ARE FINALLY GONE!! I went from 3000+ cards to a binder with maybe ~150 favourites, and a separate batch of 20 that I'm framing.) She has a bigger pool of things to purge from than me, though, because my aforementioned music collection is my biggest collection and one that's off-limits from selling unless absolutely necessary. (I still love everything I own and never felt the need to purge anything from it.)

All that to say, having a voice of reason around has been INCREDIBLY helpful to me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who benefits from it. I'm really happy with the progress I've made, and happy with my friend's progress too!

Also, I posted a while back about purging ""old self"" stuff, which in my case was mainly cookbooks. (tl;dr for those who didn't read that post: I used to be a cook, had to change fields for health reasons, cookbooks reminded me of what could have been and depressed me.) I ended up hanging on to the ones I referenced the most and the ones that were interesting to read even independently from the recipes; mostly regional cookbooks going into the history of the food and all that, books focused on a specific food (say, pasta) with a lot of specific info and tips about that food, etc. The ones that were just collections of recipes and nothing else, or that I just didn't use, I got rid of.

Decluttering storage rooms.,"A little backstory: I moved into my mother's old place when she moved.  Her new place is smaller and across the country, so naturally she only took part of everything she'd accumulated over the years, plus she also had the remaining belongings of my grandmother after she passed away. Now, I'm surrounded by my stuff, mom's stuff, grandma's stuff... 

There are two storage rooms in the basement and a back porch room *filled with stuff*. I'd say about 1/4 of it, tops, is mine, from several years ago when I stored it because I was moving. I haven't looked at it in years so aside from a couple things I know I can sell for a few bucks, I just want everything gone asap. But I just have no idea how to get started. 

Should I make a 'Trash Pile' and a 'Maybe Keep/Sell' pile and go through everything as quickly as possible, and then go through the Maybe Keep pile afterwords and decide what I really want? Or should I spend more time initially as I go through the first time and really nail down the things I absolutely want and then just toss the rest? Is one method more efficient than the other?

I'm trying to get a reasonable game plan for this, because my usual method of decluttering is just randomly getting annoyed at all the junk I run into when doing whatever thing I'm doing and then just throwing piles of it into the trash.

I haven't seen my floor in...a really long time,"The last time I was able to see my entire floor, I was about 12. I am 21 now, and it's very difficult to get started because I have no idea where to start.

I used to think I was just a messy person, but realized that I was too depressed, too unmotivated, to take care of myself, let alone my bedroom. However, after getting a new job and finding some hobbies that make me happier and eliminating some stressors in my life, I feel that it's time to tackle my room.

Honestly, it would be too embarrassing for me to post pictures for advice. My room is filled with boxes, baskets, dirty laundry, books, and a decent amount of trash.

I know that it would be best to clean up as much trash as possible at first, but, after that, I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure which baskets of clothes are clean and which are dirty anymore since I've been wearing a uniform for work the last two years and then sweatpants at home.

I bought totes to put my clothing in after I clean it until I can get to my closet to put them away and I'm planning on sorting through them and donating clothing I don't wear anymore.

But, I'm stuck on everything else. I have bookcases, but I have so many books that I'm not sure if I'll have enough room for them all.

How to declutter in a small space that must remain usable?,"Hi all, I need your advice. I live in a small 900 sq ft house that was poorly designed with almost no usable storage (two small bedroom closets that have a steeply sloping roof/ceiling so only hangers, no shelves, one is 3 ft wide by 2ft deep). I also have way too much stuff with no usable basement or attic so everything is crammed into plastic totes and bags and stacked in my guest bedroom. I want to declutter my guest bedroom but I have no place to move things out of the room to sort through them. By taking things out of the guest room into the living room (the only wide open space in the house), it would put clutter out into the most used part of the home. I do not have more than an hour (sometimes less) to declutter each night after work/extracurriculars. I don't want to leave the mess in the living area since we have pets who like to chew on things, plus it would be very stressful for me to have it out in plain sight. We plan to build a new home within a year or two so I would really like to drastically reduce the amount of stuff to take to the new house. I can't seem to tackle it since I have no place to sort through it all or to put it while it waits to be sent to donation centers or recycling/trash. Would renting a storage unit to get things out of the house so I could sort through things be unreasonable? My goal is to sort through the belongings, declutter what is not being used, and organize what is left. I am comfortable decluttering and parting with things but I really need a place to sort through it, which I don't currently have. I will have more square footage once we build and don't want it filled with stuff. We are building a house so we can entertain guests and offer out-of-state friends and family a free place to stay, not as a place to put more stuff.  I enjoy organizing but currently do not have storage space that is functional or room to install functional storage or furniture due to the size and poorly planned layout of the house (doors on multiple walls, woodstove, floor vent registers, room sq footage not large enough for dressers, no desk for computer, etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we are so close to building a new house, my spouse does not want me to buy any furniture, rearrange existing furniture, fix anything unless absolutely necessary, or improve the house in any way since we probably won't use anything we buy in the new house. We had a long talk about how much the clutter bothers me but I doubt that will change anything in spouse's mind.  Spouse is no help with keeping tidy (works a lot and is just a messy person) and also doesn't care if it stays this way until we move. I can't live this way for a whole other year or two, I really need to get this house in shape! Please help! Thanks for reading this far!

Fantastic Ideas to Simplify Your Life,"  

**Declutter, Organize and Live a Meaningful Life with Passion** 

We all have been told that things will never make us happy, but somehow we still find ourselves filling up junk drawers, countertops, closets, basements and storage spaces with the stuff that we buy but never use. Prized collections of items can devolve into hoarding; we lose the ability to separate things you actually need from the French press filter whose glass beaker broke several years ago.

In a time when we can shop whenever and wherever, people are increasingly starting to choose not to. The trend is called minimalism, a lifestyle where you boil down your possessions to only what is absolutely needed in order to focus more on nonmaterial things like happiness and relationships. It is a philosophy lived and preached by everyone from the ancient Greek philosophers, Buddhist Zen masters and Silicone Valley millionaires. There are no hard and fast principals about what to keep and what to throw away, so each minimalist has to be totally honest with themselves in order for it to work.

I'd like to introduce you to my newly released book - ""MINIMALISM"".

But they made my room look very very cluttered, so it stressed me out, but I just couldn't get rid of them. So I figured I would keep it in mind. And that's literally what I did. For a month, I let it sit, and stress me out. I was basically trying to teach myself a lesson by letting me stress myself out. Eventually, one day, I looked at them and figured ""you know what.. I mean... They're just.. there. They no longer bring me joy, they just stress me out."" I put them in a bag, and gifted them to my sister. 


Now my cabinet is empty and I feel so relieved from that stress!

Building an easy close-to-home style is not as simple as it sounds. However, to uncomplicated the procedure you essentially need to: 

figure out how to streamline your style with a case closet that spares time, cash, and vitality. 

stick to an arrangement of rules that assistance you effectively keep up your mark look. 

Here are my closet rules that will enable you to raise your style with a simple to execute process.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. RESPECT YOUR LIFESTYLE** 

Once in a while we truly need to be what we're most certainly not. Also, every time we surrender to these unlikely wants we wind up settling on poor choices. Either change the life you live or acknowledge it, however do not mind yourself out. 

Perusing Vogue publications or following a bundle of design bloggers is awesome for motivation yet the (somewhat showy) pictures they have a tendency to depict may not constantly fit with the truth of your everyday. 

With regards to building your closet how you invest the vast majority of your energy ought to be the main influencer. Else you'll have a considerable measure of stuff that looks pleasant on holders however not on you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. DRESS ONLY FOR YOURSELF** 

Now and again it appears as though ladies, specifically, settle on style decisions so they can be appealing to men or the envy of other ladies. What's more, with the ascent of metrosexuals and men of honor's form, guys seem, by all accounts, to be sticking to this same pattern. 

Yet, dressing for someone else is a noteworthy supporter of the pressure related with wardrobing. It is normal to mind what others consider you, yet when buying pieces or preparing every day their conclusion should not eclipse your own. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. MAKE DAILY UNIFORMS** 

You ought to have a bunch of day by day uniforms that make it simple to pull together a look in around 5 minutes level, and your case closet ought to be involved a progression of these uniforms. 

This is a superb style technique in light of the fact that at whatever point you are settling on a choice about what to wear (be it pressing for movement, an uncommon event, or only an ordinary day) you should simply choose one of the uniforms that applies to a specific occasion. 

My regular uniform comprises of thin pants, tennis shoes or cowhide loafers, a slipover shirt, and a larger than usual overcoat. However, I likewise have a uniform that is material for the real exercises I take part in and it makes the way toward styling myself super proficient. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. DEPEND ON THE BASICS** 

Regardless of your stylish (be it great or restless) you can profit by having a choice of staples that speak to the main part of your closet. 

These staples (or nuts and bolts) are the essential components worth spending your cash on in light of the fact that they are things that can be worn all the more regularly. 

Set aside the opportunity to decide the best staples for you, where to get them, and how to keep up them so they last. 

Spending exertion on this fair more than once per year will totally dispense with the time you squander preparing all through whatever is left of the year. 

When you have your staples set up, if you pick, you can adorn them with few extras or other more detailed clothing pieces that assistance you make a mark look. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5. ORGANIZE YOUR COMFORT** 

I seldom wear high foot sole areas since I discover them a torment to stroll in. No event will tempt me conflict with that administer in light of the fact that I know I would just think twice about it at last. 

You too ought to have a point of confinement to how far you will go for the sake of mold. Thoroughly consider a portion of your most excruciating or shocking style minutes and make a strong responsibility to never go there again. 

When you are not happy, you aren't sure. What's more, when you are not certain it demonstrates regardless of how costly, on pattern, or chic your outfit might be. 

&amp;#x200B;

**6. GO FOR A SUBTLE STYLE** 

Inconspicuously classy individuals have a charm since they are not really attempting to emerge, however, the nature of their look makes it difficult to disregard them. 

That quality is most obvious on account of the reasonable consideration they've dedicated to fit and creation — not really on the grounds that they were stressed over brand names or patterns. 

Being a mobile bulletin may stop people in their tracks yet it may not be on account of you look great — you aren't naturally an expert of style since you surged out to by the most recent it pack. 

Focusing on how certain outlines supplement your body compose and figuring out how to choose well-made articles of clothing made from astounding materials will probably get you esteem. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. PRACTICE DISCERNMENT** 

The majority of the guidelines above truly descend to my most loved and that will perceive about what you purchase, what you keep in your storage room, and what you choose to wear. 

I adore the statement by Christine Koh ""consider yourself a guardian, as opposed to a buyer"" which gets at its core. 

Another approach to take a gander at it is that your own style is simply one more zone in life that gives you the chance to act with expectation. 

Your case closet ought to be attentively gathered from an accumulation of ageless pieces that work flawlessly together, enabling you to effortlessly make outfits you cherish from few things. 

I need to pressure the significance of remaining consistent with your own style. I stick to moderation with regards to building a container closet yet in addition happen to have a moderate style. 

Your style may not be moderate but rather it does not mean you cannot profit by a simplified way to deal with culminating your storage room. 

Comprehend and fit in with your own stylish, as you can keep these guidelines regardless of the sort of look you are going for.

Donation “Control” Center,"I moved out to an apartment of my own with a friend a month ago, and the space is smaller than we are used to. It has really helped us not bring/buy so much stuff into our place unless we really need it or want it.

I started decluttering a year and a half ago, and I’m in the process of decluttering and using up everything I don’t want to give away. Last week, my mom gave me a really nice laundry basket, and at first, I was going to donate my plastic one from Walmart to Goodwill.

How do you store your extra bedding and comforters?,"3 bedrooms plus pullout couch means an extra 6 or so comforters that need to be stored somewhere.

Decluttering like it's 2023,"After a late-in-life surprise divorce and the last of my kids moved out, and time to dwell on my new situation, I'm committing to clearing out all that's clutter and to time a big sell sometime in the next 5 years.

Possessions pared down low enough that I can relocate easily as the winds blow, fit them into a medium sized moving van.

Relatives giving you stuff. Keeping stuff because it was a relative's. Just general familiarity and exchanging of stuff.,"Kinda a ramble spawned by https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/9p405f/does_anyone_get_a_visceral_hatred_of_something/e8171wi/

Yeah, so glad that I live far enough away that mom can't actually give me much more stuff without mailing it.  (Well, I do have a closet on her property, but it still means she needs to ask before giving me stuff because it's full of comic books and the atari suitcase and there's not much space left.)  I kinda gave her a bunch of my stuff, but it was with the understanding that part of it was what she could dump it into the goodwill box before leaving town.  (We need to label that stuff better, what's hers to do with as she will, and what I wanted stored.)

Finding stuff ""here"" that I know I don't want anymore, mom doesn't want anymore... offer it to the aunts.  I figured that the aunts would sell my short-lived mini-Polaroid camera in their shop-space.  (Lower-price version of an antique mall.)  I had a box of film to go with it and they're going to experiment... and hopefully find it just as unsatisfying as I did, and I couldn't even afford a digital camera when I got disgusted with the format.  (My one aunt had to get a smartphone for work.  My other aunt has been using my husband's old smartphone and dealt with the broken screen all this time just by putting a protector on it... I intended it just to be a bathroom-game and prob.  She's getting a better castoff soon.)  

I was talking to grandma today and she realizes that I don't have physical room for keepsakes.  She talked about how another relative had her closest people just throw stuff off the balcony and call the junkman.  I should have said how much I loved that their hallway was lined with photos, and how I should make sure I had digital copies.

There's this whole bunch of stuff on top of the piano that I still have trouble thinking of as more than this weirdly-shaped shelf-buffet thing.  

(One of the things that is on top of the piano is this weird key that I got on a trip, and boy-golly is it hoarder-think.  I went to England to join my Amero-expat PILs who were living in Austria for a canal-boat vacation.  During the Manchester part, we needed a specialized nut-driver to unlock some of the boat-locks because vandals like to mess with them unless it's difficult.  The key the boat-rental place gave us was worn to the point where it wouldn't work with some of the locks, and PILs got frustrated enough to buy a new one.  I was allowed to keep the old one as a souvenir, and less than two years later I let Pat-grans have it.  I can't remember how long ago it was, (I was able to watch How to Train Your Dragon first movie in German on the flight back) but the key's on the piano with the Monon collection and a bunch of redkneck garbage, with a label.  I'm not sure if the label makes it better or worse.  I didn't read the label because I figured out what it was without picking it up.)

Kinda a ramble spawned by https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/9p405f/does_anyone_get_a_visceral_hatred_of_something/e8171wi/

Yeah, so glad that I live far enough away that mom can't actually give me much more stuff without mailing it.  (Well, I do have a closet on her property, but it still means she needs to ask before giving me stuff because it's full of comic books and the atari suitcase and there's not much space left.)  I kinda gave her a bunch of my stuff, but it was with the understanding that part of it was what she could dump it into the goodwill box before leaving town.  (We need to label that stuff better, what's hers to do with as she will, and what I wanted stored.)

Finding stuff ""here"" that I know I don't want anymore, mom doesn't want anymore... offer it to the aunts.  I figured that the aunts would sell my short-lived mini-Polaroid camera in their shop-space.  (Lower-price version of an antique mall.)  I had a box of film to go with it and they're going to experiment... and hopefully find it just as unsatisfying as I did, and I couldn't even afford a digital camera when I got disgusted with the format.  (My one aunt had to get a smartphone for work.  My other aunt has been using my husband's old smartphone and dealt with the broken screen all this time just by putting a protector on it... I intended it just to be a bathroom-game and prob.  She's getting a better castoff soon.)

Does anyone else have this dream?,"Dana White talked about a recurring dream she has about finding rooms in her house that she didn't know she had.  I have that dream too, and apparently a lot of her blog-readers did as well.

I have another recurring dream where I'm on a bus, or walking through an airport, something like that, and I have to juggle my stuff as I walk because I took too much out of my backpack and didn't have time to put it back in.  Sometimes I will finally stop for a minute and try to repack my bag, but it won't all go in and I don't have time to figure out why.  One variation was that I was traveling around a mall with a violin and a couple schoolbags, and I was getting lost and tired and had to keep track of everything.

Rant: My video games.,"I dunno, I got into the PS2 after college, got a GameCube, my boyfriend got an Xbox but I didn't buy the console-specific game I wanted...  I kinda got addicted to WoW and the monthly subscription was more than I budgeted for games at the time.

I asked if I could buy a PS4, got it for Christmas... it's logged more hours as a movie-player than a gaming system.  I got frustrated with the GoW title that was cheap at the time, played Uncharted and tried to order the prequel collection but it quietly left my cart due to stocking issues, the other few games were cheap and not sequels and I didn't like them.  I got out the PS2 and got frustrated with those sequel games.  (I haven't tried getting past the first part of PoP2 since I looked up the strat.  I had it on Steam too, and blamed the lack of controller support until I couldn't get through it with the PS2 version.  I got through PoP1 and PoP3 a decade ago.)

I ordered the game that I wanted the PS4 for but the disc needed to drop in price first... PS4 hasn't been hooked up due to lack of space.  The public library has Zelda titles for Gamecube and I haven't even hooked that up.

I was at my mom's house and noticed my PS2 copy of Blood Omen 2 got shuffled into a misc sleeve of discs over 10 years ago and I didn't notice.  I have a Steam copy, and I don't think I've played that either.  (It was part of a Soul Reaver bundle, and my overdone obsession is why I forced myself to finish playing BO2 even once.)

I'm on a old gaming laptop that is contemporary to the pirate WoW server I chose, and I can access my desktop now by proxy, but I haven't gone back to doing that.  There was one game my husband got and I tried, but it makes the laptop hot at the lowest setting and I'm frustrated with it too.

Keep your house decluttered because you never know what will happen,"I’m not a hoarder but I have a lot of STUFF.  I’m lazy. Instead of “I don’t need this anymore so I’ll donate/sell it” it was more like “I have a big house and places to put stuff so I’ll put it in this closet - out of sight, out of mind!” IVE been slowly decluttering over the last year or two but never was consistent or kicked it into high enough gear. Which is dumb because so much of it is useless junk that just takes up space. 

Fast forward to now. We randomly went to an open house and fell madly in love.  we want to buy it which means we have to put ours up to list ASAP. If it was already decluttered this would already be a huge deal, but now we have to get our home ready AND declutter the shit out of it.

It’s so hard. You can’t do it all at once quickly. Even boxing stuff up to throw out and/or donate, it’s not easy to have 20 boxes you need to take to the donation center that are taking up space you’re trying to work around, and there’s only so much you can throw out at once before garbage day.  So then there’s the idea to take it to the dump but that is a pain too because of their hours.

Anyway, everything is a giant dumpster fire at this point and I want everything GONE. I have hired a company to come in and get rid of a ton of stuff because it’s the only way it will happen. It is costing a FORTUNE. 

So yeah, don’t be like me. Stay on top of stuff. I feel terrible and wasteful and lazy and stupid.

"Tips for organizing old AV, USB, Power, Ethernet, etc., cords.","For years I've carried around (from apartment to apartment, then house) a big bag of AV, USB, power, ethernet, and other cords.  It;s been a helpful bag that probably weighs close to 10 pounds now, but I almost always have the cable I need for whatever situation.  If anything I have an over abundance of the old RCA cables, but just about any new piece of tech always comes with a small piece of ethernet, or a usb cable that I just throw into the bag.

More than a few years ago to stop tangles I bought a big roll of twist tie material and did get just about everything tied up, but noticed it's still taking me a bit of time to find a particular cable in the big ole bag.  Sometimes I'll even miss the cable, go buy one, then find it when going through it later, if that tells you how many cables I have, and since they're all mostly black they all look the same.

On top of that, the bag (an old plastic mattress bag) is falling apart and I'm doing a basement reorganization/clean-up and want to take another stab at reorganizing the collection based on cable type, and probably ditching the bag.

My mind immediately goes to tool organizers bins that hang on walls, but that's much more robust and large than what I want.  The bag itself like a small suitcase, and I'd hate to give all these cables a larger footprint.

If you're worried about hoarding anything, fear not, as in this effort I will be removing many obsolete cables like the old RCA types, but since they're all just sitting in the bag I can't really keep a good count of how many I even have.",declutter,1540140333,Sigaromanzia,11,1,True,9q4ztb,2018-10-21,"Tips for organizing old AV, USB, Power, Ethernet, etc., cords.

Everything was kept, nothing sorted out. A box with expensive shirts and cashemire pullover. New, in their package.

I have been lurking this sub and getting some great ideas and motivation to tackle my huge storage room.  6 hours later I have went through every last corner and was able to throw out 3 big garbage bags of junk, and I am donating 3 big garbage bags of things I do not need anymore. I feel so relieved and happy. I ended up keeping 1 bin of memories (instead of 4 full bins) and it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be to get rid of a lot of it.  

I am going to tackle my bookshelves next (3). I am not sure how to go about doing this because I have kept every single book I have ever owned and don't really want to get rid of them.  How do you decide what book is good enough to keep and what should be donated?",0

I'm doing it...I'm getting rid of the dining table.,"The one where I've eaten dinner a total of less than 10 times the last 5 years. The one that slowly turns into a mountain of random stuff until I need to find something and everything crashes to the floor or I go crazy looking at it and do a terrible declutter. 

Pictures and measurements have been taken, and I've written most of the post for the ad. Trying to get a tiny bit of money out of it at first, but if it doesn't sell, it's going away for free. 

I've been thinking about it for a while, but there's this little voice in my head (that sounds exactly like my mother) telling me that I need somewhere to serve dinner guests. 

Then I remember, the last time I had dinner guests was two years ago. If the situation comes up, I'll find a solution. But the table isn't it.

"I've been years since I've started decluttering; I found the ""feel"" goal and as much as I enjoy organization and decluttering, I'm tired of declutterng the same area over and over...","I started thinking about my decluttering ""journey"" and I thought of sharing it. I think that it is unorganized, but there is some good things about a raw thought... 

&amp;#x200B;

I found my goal ""state of being"" in regards to decluttering and how I want my own space to feel. It was when I lived out of a carry on suitcase while travelling/staying with various people/relatives for about 5 months. I realized that I really don't need that much. It's easy to get caught up wanting more things for ""fun"" and I'm learning more and more to appreciate things, but I don't have to own it or do it. When I had only a carry-on suitcase worth of things I felt more like getting up and doing things.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also learning to cope with having all of my things within my one room, and not even having all of the space to myself. I wish I had a different assortment of furniture. I am not allowed to change anything. I bought a few metal dish selves from Ikea and I feel a lot better. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to stop repeating the same thing over and over I have a few rules... 

1. Do it with 100% of me. Or: Don't have ass it. Put your full effort in.
2. Don't stock up (... too much). This one is tricky because in order to not stockpile things for later use, I need to feel more comfortable with my income. There is an extent to reusing everything before it becomes hoarding. 
3. Makeup/skincare: don't buy more than 1 of each of each category (unless distinct, specific needs) until you are done, or very very close to done. I am not too happy with my makeup remover right now. But I am going to wait until I make it thought at least 80% of the bottle because if I buy something new and I like that one more then I won't want to finish this one. And then I have more clutter.
4. Put things away well. Just because you can pack all of your clothes in that drawer doesn't mean you should. Do I have the energy to carefully put it back? Probably not. I need wiggle room.
5. Appreciate things without owning them.
6. Don't forget your roles in life.
7. don't leave things for later. Find/make a time to do it. 
8. Master list of to do. Your inbox is not it. 
9. Sometimes I get selling gitters. When after I sell it I miss it. 
10. Urgency vs. importance
11. If you start feeling mad buy the item that will solve the problem. (Don't forget to check the return policy)

Shelf solution has me defeated. Need motivation or better ideas.,"I was ranting in the challenge topic. I should just make a post about it.

My kitchen shelves in the rental apartment:

[https://imgur.com/YQagpnV](https://imgur.com/YQagpnV)

My kitchen is a bit messy, but there is actually plenty of space, but it is utilized so poorly. All the shelves are like this, not just my pans-shelf. For the pans, it's very easy to just throw them all in like you see here since I don't have much else. But the other shelves contain my tupperware that come cascading down about twice a week. I can probably add 1 shelf in the tupperware and be able to fit my alufoil, ziplock cases etc on that teeny slim shelf that would result in the middle of these meagre THREE (3!!!) slots. 

((Why??? whyyyyy!!!) Nothing fits in that slim space! Why couldn't they design proper cabineeeeeets! Aughghghgh.))

1. I have to figure out what the hell kind of shelves these are, to be able to buy the correct shelf i need (how?)
2. I have to actually buy the shelf (i hate it and it's hard)
3. I have to bother my partner about driving somehwere to buy/ pick it up. Using up our little free time.  Even more friction.

I’m getting weird,"Over the summer I *finally* read The Life-Changing yada yada and made some major changes to my (let’s be real) hoarding attitudes and lifestyle. I let go of things with love, thanked them for their service, etc. and learned to respect myself enough to not use expired products that were “still ok” or wear clothes that didn’t fit, etc. It was incredibly liberating and I literally made room for new things in my life (new job, new work space in my house). I discovered that surrounding myself with stuff wasn’t keeping me “safe,” but that saving money wisely and not spending would.

Fast forward to now and I’m feeling a little weird...I want to go WAY minimal (like, one red bottle of nail polish, one nude bottle of nail polish, that’s it).

And that’s the one I have and that’s the one I use and that’s the one I rebuy...has this happened to anyone else? 

I’m not pulling the trigger on it because I actually still have a ton of usable products that I want to try to work through first (personal challenge!) but I was just wondering if anyone else had felt this way before.

Moving after Graduation and Cant Bear to Declutter College T-Shirts,"Hi all. I'm graduating in December and moving away from my college town. By far the biggest thing I'm having trouble decluttering is all the free and cool t-shirts I've collected over my past few years relating to my college.

I don't know the feasibility of wearing shirts for my old college in a new city with it's own culture, universities, and sports teams. I want to keep a few for alumni events I'll go to and for visits back to the area, but I don't know how to choose or how many would be the 'right' number. So many of them have sentimental value connected to the event they were at, so that makes it even more difficult.

What's your definition of decluttering?,"I confess, I'v read a lot of posts here about decluttering a cupboard or two at a time. I feel like that would be so much more work and, maybe, work without end. You're on cupboard #16 (good work), and you find something that belongs in cupboard # 1. But cupboard # 1 is already put back together, with all the spaces filled. What do you do?

For me, decluttering is not tidying, it’s not deep cleaning, it’s not even organizing. It involves these three things, but decluttering is the wholesale sorting and culling of unnecessary items, usually from an overcrowded space, in order to make the space more pleasant and more useful.  Done well, it may not need to be done again for many years, maybe never again.

For example, I regularly go through my kitchen cupboards and fridge, removing old food, cleaning up spills, getting rid of dishes and glasses that are chipped or no longer match. I would call this maintenance, not decluttering and I expect to do this regularly forever. 

In contrast, I had a serious challenge with my spice drawer and needed to find a whole new way of dealing with those less expensive but inconvenient cellophane bags of spice. Plus, I was pretty sure I had at least 3 cinnamons, one of which I had had when I moved into the place, 20 years ago. Dealing with my spice drawer is what *I* call decluttering. With a proper system for storing and cataloging, I will never need to do that work again.

Done well, it may not need to be done again for many years, maybe never again.

For example, I regularly go through my kitchen cupboards and fridge, removing old food, cleaning up spills, getting rid of dishes and glasses that are chipped or no longer match. I would call this maintenance, not decluttering and I expect to do this regularly forever. 

In contrast, I had a serious challenge with my spice drawer and needed to find a whole new way of dealing with those less expensive but inconvenient cellophane bags of spice. Plus, I was pretty sure I had at least 3 cinnamons, one of which I had had when I moved into the place, 20 years ago. Dealing with my spice drawer is what *I* call decluttering. With a proper system for storing and cataloging, I will never need to do that work again.

A moment's silence please - a sacred cow has been slain,"So I did it. I gave away the last of my retro computing stuff - all my Commodore gear. Fair amount too - a C64, the disk drive, the tape drive, a modern flash card cartridge adapter, a C64-compatible mouse (relatively rare), fair amount of tape software, fair amount of disk software, a box of blank 5 1/4"" disks, two joysticks including an original Commodore triangular one...

This equipment has been part of who I think I am for a long time. 80s computers are a massive influence on who am I today, including career and hobbies (writing synth music). Having a real C64 just there available to switch on and ready to go? Perfect. Except one tiny detail - I never actually *did* switch it on, whether it was ready to go or not. In fact it just took up space, gathered dust and made me vaguely guilty about checking whether it and all the software were still working.

I've given it all away to another enthusiast - a good home has been found, and it's going to see active use. We all win - I get my space back and stop feeling guilty, someone else gets a machine they really want. I didn't want to sell it  - partly because packing would have been difficult and also partly because I would have used the selling and packing preparations as an excuse not to do it.

I do still have one piece of retro kit left - [my first ever game](http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tomy/AstroBlaster.htm), but that takes up a tiny amount of shelf space and is much more explicitly there for decoration. The C64 stuff was intended for active use, and simply didn't see any from me.

How to declutter old clothes that I still wear despite having new replacements?,I absolutely hate clothes shopping; everything from the size issues when ordering online to having to go outside of the female junior's clothing aisle since the fast fashion material there feels synthetic and cheap. I spend perhaps 6 hrs a month on clothing shopping and end up with only a few pieces (and thus way under my monthly clothes budget so that's a plus at least :\\ ). Now I'm sitting here in my 6.5 year old 'good enough' hoodie from high school \[that has smelly sleeves from getting wet there too many times while washing the dishes\] despite having 2 'favorite' new hoodies sitting in my closet for half a year now. I should have thrown it away 3 years ago but I fear of the challenge and time commitment of finding a new one that I would 'love' once my new hoodies get to this stage. Now extend this weird phenomenon to all my categories of my clothes and shoes. I have about 170 items \[clothing + shoes + accessories\] in total so I don't think it's much of a hoarding issue as much as perhaps a laziness issue.

Clueless about decluttering,"So I currently live in a flat with two other people, but am moving into my own 2 bedroom flat at the end of this month, finally! 

I don’t really have much furniture as it came with the flat I originally rented. I am currently in the process of purchasing new furniture for my new place. Thank god...one less thing to declutter. 

Decorating is underway and I’m going for a pretty minimalistic feel, which I’m stoked about. 

Because there are 2 bedrooms and only myself, I was just going to keep everything I have at the moment. However, I’ve realised this is not ideal as I have a lot of things I really won’t ever wear or use again. 

I HATE HATE HATE throwing clothes out. I’m not sure why, but I have things from when I was 10 (11 years ago!) in my wardrobe still.

I’ve realised I really need to declutter my things, mainly my clothes, as I feel it’s the right thing to do and allows me to have a ‘fresh start’, and toes into my main theme. Does anyone have any advice on decluttering and organising?

"Decluttering ""Gifts""","Hey all.  I've been really depressed lately, and I finally pinpointed that it mainly has to do with all the junk around me.  I live in a small 2 bedroom ranch style apartment, so there is not much space.  I am constantly throwing or giving away things, except I am not getting anywhere because my mom keeps bringing crap over.  She visits me 1-2 a week, or every other week depending on her schedule.  Every visit she brings a stack of coupons(about an inch thick), a couple newspaper clippings, some kind of toy/craft for my daughter, and food she made.  A few times a month she brings over clothes for the kiddo(that she doesn't really need), more larger toys, cardboard for crafts, random craft supplies I don't use, etc.  Typing it out, it doesn't seem like much.  However, if you looked in my closets and daughter's room you would understand.

I have three closets in the house--master bedroom, daugther's room, and a hallway closet.  The hallway closet has our outdoor/long storage stuff, vacuum, and free standing utility shelf as my pantry.  I also have random pots and pans that were given to me shoved in there since my kitchen cupboards are full.  Oh yea, they are full of plastic cups and plates my mom buys for my daughter.  Every holiday or season or sale she brings over that stuff.  And small(shoebox size or less) containers for ""organizing"". 

The thing is, she keeps giving me this stuff and tells me to use it or save it.  Some of it is my childhood belongings, which honestly, I really don't care about.  *She* has memories attached to that stuff, not me.  I recently got a cache of dress recital outfits, toys, and boxed barbies that I am not to part with.  The Barbies are shoved in my hallway closet, which is taking up space for my pantry items.  I actually threw out most of that stuff, and she hasn't noticed yet.  There was even a few large accordian style folders with random school papers and crap.  Definitley got rid of that.  I have absolutely no use for that stuff.  

The main problem is daugther's room.  1/3 of the actual floor space is taken up by toys.  Toys in bins or just loose on the floor.  She has a rocking horse my mom painted for her and a large power wheels that needs to GO.  But I was strictly told not to get rid of those.  She also has a pretty big Fisher Price farm set and some MLP dollhouse--but she actually plays with those daily.  All of those little random toys and knick knacks...not really.  Nothing expensive either.  All hand me downs my mom brings over, that were originally bought at yard sales anyway.  I don't think Salvation Army would even keep them.  I do not see a lot of small toys at our store, or the Goodwill.  

So...the big question is...what do I do? Where do I start? As grim as it sounds, I kept telling myself to just wait until she passes away to toss everything guilt free.  But, that's just not logical.  I'm missing out on doing enjoyable things in my own home.  I can't buy any decorations, toys, or crafts I actually want due to lack of storage.  All I do is stuff my closets and hope things disappear.  I've been playing video games a lot since that is the only place I can control the clutter.

I know, I'm the adult...just toss it or donate it...but I have no idea what to say when my mom asks where X item is next time she visits--yes, she does this.  This week I'm going to tell her to take the Power Wheels and rocking horse back.  Not sure what about everything else though.  Is it okay to just toss the junky toys? What about my ""collectible"" dolls?

This is where I currently live. I have always struggled with organisation and my goal moving here was to tackle that. I was doing an okay job. But then I started working full time and my mental health has started to get worse. As a result my place got messy. I want a cute clean place to live in but I have a hard time knowing where to start. I am thinking of getting another storage bin and something to put in my closet to organise it as well as hanging something on the pipe by the wall on my ceiling to store things in. I find I get easily overwhelmed by this kind of thing. Listening to songs or a podcast helps but I still find myself overwhelmed and distracted. I am also close to becoming a hoarder and find myself having a hard time getting rid of things like paper bags and margarine containers because I might need them later. Though I have been getting better and been getting rid of containers and bags. One of my main problems is clothes. I ran a depop site where I sold vintage clothes. This was like the only thing on my resume and the only reason I got a job. But now that I'm working full time my job doesn't give me enough time to run it. Plus the post office I go to isn't open on weekends when I'm usually off. But I also want to go into fashion marketing fall 2019 and really need a solid portfolio which makes me hesitant to consign the clothes as having them photographed and sold on my depop would help me get into school. I have a giant bag of clothes by my door and a bin under my clothes rack and I have more of these clothes at my old house I need to bring back. I was thinking I could try selling them at a flea market or something. But maybe I should just consign for the sake of my own mental health and well being.

Inheriting clutter,"I recently moved again and realized my experience slowly letting go of the clutter I inherited might be useful to others. 

A little context - my mom passed away six years ago and I was named execucter for her estate. At the time of her passing I ended up dividing her worldly possessions between my sister and I before carting it all back home. 

Fast forward a few months. I was now living with my partner and surrounded by my mother's furniture, knick-knacks and sentimental items. 

Then we moved. 

After the move we had enough storage to keep her items safe while I figured out what the hell I wanted to keep (at this point I wanted to keep everything because I realized that was everything I would ever own that was connected to my mom). 

A year passed and I found myself facing the end of a relationship: enter decluttering. 

Within two months I was forced to downsize rapidly in order to fit into a one-person apartment. I noticed that furniture was the first thing to go because I just didn't have enough space. By the time I was packed to move I have to admit I still filled a 26-foot truck.

This was my wake-up call. 

Inevitably I realized that I couldn't keep everything my mom had owned while she was alive. After all, this was my life and I should feel comfortable in the space I'm in.

After three years of slowly letting go I can honestly say that I own almost nothing I inherited, save a few artworks, decorative plates, Christmas ornaments and an antique icebox. I ended up using the konmari process from atart to finish twice, as well as regular declutter challenges from this sub to stay motivated.

It has taken a while, but I can finally breathe easy again. Another move later and I'm finally letting go of the idea that my memories of my mom are exclusively tied to her material possessions. It seems almost silly now. I'm lucky to have photos, a few gifts and a couple of items from her for those days I was to remember. Letting go of the clutter I inherited was more about giving myself permission to move on and overcoming the fear that I would somehow forget the woman who shaped the person I am today.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's ok to let someone else's stuff go. To all my fellow declutterers dealing with the clutter of a deceased love one, keep strong, you'll get there eventually.

This was my wake-up call. 

Inevitably I realized that I couldn't keep everything my mom had owned while she was alive. After all, this was my life and I should feel comfortable in the space I'm in.

After three years of slowly letting go I can honestly say that I own almost nothing I inherited, save a few artworks, decorative plates, Christmas ornaments and an antique icebox. I ended up using the konmari process from atart to finish twice, as well as regular declutter challenges from this sub to stay motivated.

It has taken a while, but I can finally breathe easy again. Another move later and I'm finally letting go of the idea that my memories of my mom are exclusively tied to her material possessions. It seems almost silly now. I'm lucky to have photos, a few gifts and a couple of items from her for those days I was to remember. Letting go of the clutter I inherited was more about giving myself permission to move on and overcoming the fear that I would somehow forget the woman who shaped the person I am today.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's ok to let someone else's stuff go. To all my fellow declutterers dealing with the clutter of a deceased love one, keep strong, you'll get there eventually.

On Remembering Gifts,"I currently live with my dad and his girlfriend. She has a tendency to give me clothes she doesn't wear anymore, along with buying me new clothes and accessories for the any gift-giving holiday.

However, it isn't uncommon for her to ask to borrow something back she gave me every few months, or saying I should wear something that I donated long ago. Just now, she asked to wear something she gave me that was in my donation pile. 

I'm worried I'll hurt her feelings if I told her I don't know where they went, or donated them considering a lot are of good quality. (This happened with my grandmother on a purse once) 

Is there anyway I can handle this 'borrowing back gifts' guilt free?

So before you purge past the point of good reason, lean on some 20/20 hindsight and peruse this list of things that other people regret decluttering out of their homes. Who knows? Later on, you might wish you had hung onto them for dear life.

## 1. Personal paperwork

""For over 30 years, I was a freelance producer in film, mostly commercials,"" says **Ben Bryant** of Los Angeles. ""When I moved on to run my own video company, my wife and I did a cleanup and I tossed my work record books containing details of jobs, colleagues. and fees.""

&amp;#x200B;

## 2. Photos where you look less than perfect

Maybe you want to be ruthless about chucking those physical photos where you have red-eye. But look for who else is in the picture before you head to the trash bin.

## 3. Iconic clothing

Santoro recalls a client who regretted getting rid of his 1980s Guess jacket.

""He wishes he still had it for '80s-themed parties, which, due to his age, are more frequent than he would have guessed back when he purged his wardrobe,"" she says..

## 4. Items you like that just don't fit in your current space

When **Christie**'s (no last name given) grandmother passed away in 2013, each grandchild received a framed photograph she had taken of a nature scene.

""But at the time, I had no extra wall space to hang it,"" says the Boise, ID, resident. The picture was put in her closet. Then in the midst of decluttering for a move, she decided to get rid of it. And it wasn't until Christie saw similar photos in her sisters' homes that she felt a loss.

## 5. Items you're too young to appreciate

**Jacquie Denny** was a 23-year-old just getting started on her career when her mother decluttered the family home. Anything she wanted to keep needed to go or it would be tossed, her mom told her.

""I wasn't thinking that I would want that goofy scrapbook I kept during my teen years,"" says Denny, who later co-founded the estate sale service Everything But the House. ""But now, it’s gone for good, and that black-and-white photograph signed by all four Beatles would be nice to have!""

## 6. Real jewelry along with fake

**Gilat Tunit**, owner and founder of the Project Neat, had a client who accidentally threw away her mother's heirloom (and very expensive!) necklace. Um, why?

""Somehow while decluttering her old costume jewelry, she threw out her mother's very real necklace,"" says Tunit. By the time the woman realized what she had done, the necklace was long gone.

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Bunch Of Hooks

Nothing works better than a bunch of extra hooks over the door.

On Stuff,"What would you do if you had to leave tomorrow with nothing but what you could carry? Would you load up a suitcase full of pictures and clothes? Would you stuff as many books as you could possibly manage into a box and lug it on your shoulders? Would you bring the bare essentials of a few toiletries, a change of clothes, and a hard drive with all of your pictures? 

We seem to collect so much stuff in our lives, but what do we really need? When I go on vacation I try to bring as little as possible. When I’m there, I realize that I don’t miss anything that I left at home and could probably do without half of the things I brought along.

We don’t really need all of the things sitting in our closets, cabinets, boxes, and cars. You could lose everything you owned tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. You would get over it. Sure you’d be sad about a few sentimental items. You’d miss your favorite shirt and pictures of your kids, but you’d go on.

If we don’t need any of this stuff, then why do we spend our whole lives collecting it? Why do we spend thousands of dollars a year on homes with extra closets, basements, and attics to store things that we don’t even look at?

Why do people get angry when they lose things? What does it matter?

The only thing that matters in your life is your experiences. What you do today is all that matters. If you enjoy yourself and are happy then you are on the right track. Why would you keep doing it if you hated what you were doing? Why do we sit in cubicles in stuffy offices so that we can make enough money to buy things?

Then we buy things and have nowhere to put them, so we need to buy a house to store our stuff. But the house you can afford is way out in the suburbs because you need that third bedroom and the two car garage to store your stuff. So now you need to buy a car to drive yourself from your suburban home to your job.

Well that car costs money, the house costs money, and all that stuff costs money. It costs so much, in fact, that you need to work harder to find a better job so that you can afford it more easily.

So now you are already working a job in a cubicle that you don’t like, but are sucking up to a boss that annoys you so that you can get a promotion to pay for all of the stuff that you couldn’t really afford in the first place.

All the while, you still have to make your mortgage payments and your car payments. Not to mention those student loan payments because you had to get that good education so that you could get that “good” job in the first place.

All of these things keep weighing on us as time goes on. The debt never quite seems to go away. Yet, the house keeps getting smaller as you keep filling it up with more stuff.

Somewhere along the way you maybe get married and have kids. With the extra people and all of that stuff, you’re completely out of space and have to buy a bigger house. You still haven’t paid off the first one, but manage to sell it at a small profit. You put that profit into the new house, but it still has a pretty big mortgage payment. The problem is that you had to move farther out into the suburbs to find a bigger house that you could afford, so you might as well buy a new car that gets better gas mileage. Oh and don’t forget the second car or minivan to take care of those kids.

Now you’ve just spent thousands more dollars moving all of your stuff into the new house and on down payments and of course new furniture because you need something nice for the new place. Well now you’re really strapped for money, but luckily all of that hard work paid off and you’ve become a manager with a higher paycheck. Unfortunately, now you’re even more busy and don’t get to see your kids as much because you’re working till eight every night, but at least you can afford to buy them new toys and send them to that expensive after school program.

But it doesn’t end there. Those toys take up space. They’re just more stuff. You keep acquiring more of that stuff. It’ll eventually lead to another house, maybe another promotion, and don’t forget saving for college.

Everything keeps piling up. Eventually you’re making three times more than what you were when you were making when you started out. If you’re lucky that is. But for some reason, you aren’t saving any of it. You always seem to be running paycheck to paycheck.

Your kids eventually graduate and leave for college or a job. Then you finally decide that it’s time to downsize your lifestyle. You move into a smaller house and get the smaller car. You sell some of your stuff, but it still clutters up your home. You want to travel more, but now you’re always busy with meetings because of your high paying job.

All of this keeps going on. It’s an endless cycle of making more money so you can spend more and more. Eventually you retire and things are okay. Maybe you even pay off your mortgage and own your home. All that hard work finally paid off now you want to travel, but now your health is going. All of that stress from the job has given you heart issues. Maybe your wife or husband is suffering from cancer.

You finally have all the time in the world to travel, but you’re both sick and don’t want to leave the house any more. You get better, your wife beats cancer, but now you’re in your 70s and are too tired to go anywhere. All the while your kids visit less and less. Your friends are starting to die off. Maybe you even lose your spouse.

Your house is still full of all of the stuff you’ve collected over the years. You have a basement and attic full of boxes of things you don’t even remember. Your kids grumble about who will have to clean it up when you die. You sit in your house all day waiting for one of your kids or grandkids to visit. You make sure your stuff is organized and clean so that anybody who visits will be impressed with your tidy home.

Then you really get sick. This time it’s for real. You lay there in the hospital with a nurse whose name you can’t remember. Your stuff is so far away from you. You don’t even remember 1/10th of it all. Maybe you do remember that you never saw the Great Wall of China or rode the Tube in London.

Maybe you even have some consciousness in the end and realize that you worked so hard your entire life to buy all of that stuff, but in the end it’s all just sitting in your house while you drift away in some hospital bed while your kids cry in the next room. You realize that you didn’t spend half of the time doing what you wanted to do because of all that stuff.

Then you die. The funeral is nice with lots of flowers. Most of the young kids don’t even know what’s going on. A few weeks later your kids take a few things from your house for sentimental reasons. They need to add to their stockpile of stuff.

Then they sell the rest of it or donate it to good will. They’ll probably just throw half of your stuff away. All of the stuff that you worked so hard to accumulate will be gone. You don’t get to take it with you. And the worst part is that it takes the most precious thing away from you.

http://survivingthecubicle.com/2011/08/03/stuff/",declutter,1538026131,turkaturkat,13,26,True,9ja4z0,2018-09-27,"On Stuff What would you do if you had to leave tomorrow with nothing but what you could carry? Would you load up a suitcase full of pictures and clothes? Would you stuff as many books as you could possibly manage into a box and lug it on your shoulders? Would you bring the bare essentials of a few toiletries, a change of clothes, and a hard drive with all of your pictures? 

We seem to collect so much stuff in our lives, but what do we really need? When I go on vacation I try to bring as little as possible. When I’m there, I realize that I don’t miss anything that I left at home and could probably do without half of the things I brought along.

We don’t really need all of the things sitting in our closets, cabinets, boxes, and cars. You could lose everything you owned tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. You would get over it. Sure you’d be sad about a few sentimental items. You’d miss your favorite shirt and pictures of your kids, but you’d go on.

If we don’t need any of this stuff, then why do we spend our whole lives collecting it? Why do we spend thousands of dollars a year on homes with extra closets, basements, and attics to store things that we don’t even look at?

Why do people get angry when they lose things? What does it matter?

The only thing that matters in your life is your experiences. What you do today is all that matters. If you enjoy yourself and are happy then you are on the right track. Why would you keep doing it if you hated what you were doing? Why do we sit in cubicles in stuffy offices so that we can make enough money to buy things?

Then we buy things and have nowhere to put them, so we need to buy a house to store our stuff. But the house you can afford is way out in the suburbs because you need that third bedroom and the two car garage to store your stuff. So now you need to buy a car to drive yourself from your suburban home to your job.

Well that car costs money, the house costs money, and all that stuff costs money. It costs so much, in fact, that you need to work harder to find a better job so that you can afford it more easily.

So now you are already working a job in a cubicle that you don’t like, but are sucking up to a boss that annoys you so that you can get a promotion to pay for all of the stuff that you couldn’t really afford in the first place.

All the while, you still have to make your mortgage payments and your car payments. Not to mention those student loan payments because you had to get that good education so that you could get that “good” job in the first place.

All of these things keep weighing on us as time goes on. The debt never quite seems to go away. Yet, the house keeps getting smaller as you keep filling it up with more stuff.

Somewhere along the way you maybe get married and have kids. With the extra people and all of that stuff, you’re completely out of space and have to buy a bigger house. You still haven’t paid off the first one, but manage to sell it at a small profit. You put that profit into the new house, but it still has a pretty big mortgage payment. The problem is that you had to move farther out into the suburbs to find a bigger house that you could afford, so you might as well buy a new car that gets better gas mileage. Oh and don’t forget the second car or minivan to take care of those kids.

Now you’ve just spent thousands more dollars moving all of your stuff into the new house and on down payments and of course new furniture because you need something nice for the new place. Well now you’re really strapped for money, but luckily all of that hard work paid off and you’ve become a manager with a higher paycheck. Unfortunately, now you’re even more busy and don’t get to see your kids as much because you’re working till eight every night, but at least you can afford to buy them new toys and send them to that expensive after school program.

But it doesn’t end there. Those toys take up space. They’re just more stuff. You keep acquiring more of that stuff. It’ll eventually lead to another house, maybe another promotion, and don’t forget saving for college.

Everything keeps piling up. Eventually you’re making three times more than what you were when you were making when you started out. If you’re lucky that is. But for some reason, you aren’t saving any of it. You always seem to be running paycheck to paycheck.

Your kids eventually graduate and leave for college or a job. Then you finally decide that it’s time to downsize your lifestyle. You move into a smaller house and get the smaller car. You sell some of your stuff, but it still clutters up your home. You want to travel more, but now you’re always busy with meetings because of your high paying job.

All of this keeps going on. It’s an endless cycle of making more money so you can spend more and more. Eventually you retire and things are okay. Maybe you even pay off your mortgage and own your home. All that hard work finally paid off now you want to travel, but now your health is going. All of that stress from the job has given you heart issues. Maybe your wife or husband is suffering from cancer.

You finally have all the time in the world to travel, but you’re both sick and don’t want to leave the house any more. You get better, your wife beats cancer, but now you’re in your 70s and are too tired to go anywhere. All the while your kids visit less and less. Your friends are starting to die off. Maybe you even lose your spouse.

Your house is still full of all of the stuff you’ve collected over the years. You have a basement and attic full of boxes of things you don’t even remember. Your kids grumble about who will have to clean it up when you die. You sit in your house all day waiting for one of your kids or grandkids to visit. You make sure your stuff is organized and clean so that anybody who visits will be impressed with your tidy home.

Then you really get sick. This time it’s for real. You lay there in the hospital with a nurse whose name you can’t remember. Your stuff is so far away from you. You don’t even remember 1/10th of it all. Maybe you do remember that you never saw the Great Wall of China or rode the Tube in London.

Maybe you even have some consciousness in the end and realize that you worked so hard your entire life to buy all of that stuff, but in the end it’s all just sitting in your house while you drift away in some hospital bed while your kids cry in the next room. You realize that you didn’t spend half of the time doing what you wanted to do because of all that stuff.

Then you die. The funeral is nice with lots of flowers. Most of the young kids don’t even know what’s going on. A few weeks later your kids take a few things from your house for sentimental reasons. They need to add to their stockpile of stuff.

Then they sell the rest of it or donate it to good will. They’ll probably just throw half of your stuff away. All of the stuff that you worked so hard to accumulate will be gone. You don’t get to take it with you. And the worst part is that it takes the most precious thing away from you.

"Update on ""Back to One Box a Day.""","I've read all your replies, and I appreciate your guidance, but some of you don't seem to understand how much space 100 boxes takes up in a 520 sf apartment. Even a 10x14 bedroom with 100 boxes, 5 piece of furniture and a closet crammed full is unworkable. There is just no space.

I have no car, so things that are supposed to be sold or donated get stacked up in the LR until I can get rid of them. I took some of the ""keep"" boxes out of the BR and stacked them in the LR, but now I only have narrow paths to get around in there, and the visual clutter is too much on me emotionally. Plus, as a senior, I'm afraid I'm going to fall trying to work my way around them.

This isn't the first time I've been through these boxes. I've been through some of them every time I moved, and got rid of some stuff then. I have these boxes because I had determined that this was stuff I couldn't live without. Seems I could live without some of it, but not as much as I thought. I went through 10 more boxes and didn't find one thing to sell or donate. It's all usable stuff.

I've decided to get a 2 BR apartment. I know those of you who think I could get rid of more would not agree with that, but that's my decision. I have my reasons for wanting to keep what I want to keep, and most of them are valid. It's useful stuff, things that if I had more space, I would use for crafts or decorating or whatever, but I would use it. I just need space.

I can't live like this anymore. It's just too stressful, so I'm saving now for a move to a 2 br in the sister complex, which isn't quite as nice, but cheaper. It will be about $50 more a month, which is cheaper than storage, and will give me space to spread out and make room for everything. The new apartment has 3x the closet space, which will allow me to stash more boxes until I can set up a place for them.

Thanks for all your suggestions, but this just won't work for me. I'm not a minimalist, and would never be happy as a minimalist. I don't think a small 2 BR for one person who needs a craft and hobby room is too much. I can't create space here, no matter how many shelves I buy or how far up the wall I go. I simply need more room.

I need advice on how to declutter a 4-bedroom house in two days,"My husband and I have to move frequently for work (about once a year). It looks like we'll be moving again early next year. I have some time off work in 2 weeks and we've dedicated 2 days to decluttering the house ahead of the next move. We'll have 9 hours each day when we can actually get stuff done since our child will be in daycare. I'll have a half-day later that week to remove everything from the house that is for donation/trash/recycling. My goal is to reduce the *volume* of our stuff as much as possible (which means I'm not bothering with sorting through papers, since that'll take forever and free up only a small amount of space). We've already gone through furniture.

I'm not worried about decision fatigue, as that hasn't really been an issue with decluttering in the past, but I do tend to get distracted by low-priority areas. If I have a plan in place beforehand, I think it'll be easier to stay on track. At the moment, I can only think to go room-by-room.

Declutter to regain control of your life,"Hey everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, sorry for my (bad) English, since it´s not my native language. I just signed up to Reddit to share my experience with you (and maybe improve my English a little bit :-P ).

&amp;#x200B;

I´m have been living in a condo with my girlfriend now for almost 5 years. Last June I was overwhelmed of everything...work, college, stuff....

I got a panic attack and was in a really bad condition. I wasn´t able to stay calm anymore in any situation. Everything stressed me out and I was really sensitive about negative talk. I thought about giving up my study or quitting my job. I needed to change something in my life. I was really discontent with my situation and wanted to regain control of my life.

Then I found something that really hooked me up...minimalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I never was an impulse buyer or a hoarder or something like that, I started decluttering the condo and the cellar. I knew that I had a lot of stuff but when I´m now reconsidering how much I threw away....omg I still can´t believe it. I had old school stuff, old photos, toys and gaming consoles from my adolescence...

Old pillows, blankets, clothes, bags, furniture which was stored in the cellar. I threw everyhing away....Must´ve been at least 100 - 150 bags of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I would´ve never named me a hoarder...but I was. I stored everything because I thought I would need those things again. But to be honest...when would I´ve ever needed old school stuff? Everything I´d like to learn again is available in the WWW. Same goes for furniture, clothes and so on...

&amp;#x200B;

Since our plan is, to sell the condo in the future and buy a house (I know not very minimalistic but we´d like to see our future kids playing in the garden), my decluttering sessions are a big plus. If I´m thinking that i would´ve had to move everything I threw away, I´m really glad that I dumped it....No item would´ve been worth the effort carrying it to a new home.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I´m not yet at the point I´d like to be and still have a lot of stuff, I´m on a good way and want to continue my decluttering sessions. I´m already feeling a little bit released and more free and due to that...more happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe somebody feels the same. Just try getting rid of your stuff and just living with the things you´re really using. Maybe you will then be more happy and content...just like me

Finished a Month Long Declutter Challenge,"I read a comment here once about trying a month long declutter challenge where each day you get rid of the same number of items as the date. The first day you get rid of one thing, the second day two, repeating the pattern until 30 items on day thirty. This idea appealed to me as a way to stay focused all month and have a progress metric to keep myself on track.

I used a [whiteboard with a dot representing each item I would get rid of](https://imgur.com/gallery/BbPO6FJ); each row is one day (this is called an nth triangle number, btw, for any math folks out there). Each time I decluttered, I erased a dot for each item. It was very satisfying seeing my triangle shrink throughout the month. For a 30 day month this works out to 465 items.

The number was a bit intimidating, so I started out by making a list of each area in my apartment and guessing how many items I would need to get rid of to stay on track. This helped me break it down into manageable sections. I won't lie, I had a lot of fun keeping track and reorganizing different spaces throughout my place!

The reality of this challenge was that it was a motivator, not a strict rule. I knew I wouldn't have time every day, and that some areas would better be done all at once instead of broken up. I decided that so long as my ""progress date"" never fell behind my ""actual date"" then I could go at whatever pace I liked when I had time. Thus, I stayed motivated and on track all month. One thing that I would have done differently would be to draw a triangle around my dots so that it would still have a nice shape as it emptied out, purely for aesthetic purposes. 

The end result: a kitchen with wide open counters, clean cupboards and drawers, and no expired old products I won't use; a pared down closet that fits all my clothes and some Konmari folded shelves; nothing under my bed, and way less things on the floor around my apartment; a more accessible storage room with things I know I'll use or want to keep; a clean and organized bathroom with no more useless old makeup and half  filled products; and finally, a clearer mind and a happier space.

I'm just finishing sorting through the pile into trash/donate/attempt to sell and I'm feeling really great. My end number is exactly **500 items**, and I didn't even get to every space on my list! My future goals are to finish those last few spaces, to not have anything on the floor except furniture, and to take on at least one more challenge because I still feel I have too many things. The future goals will start tomorrow, as I'd like to keep September at 500. It's just such a perfect number to end the challenge on! I barely had to make any difficult choices this month so I know I could pare down some more.

Depression mess,I've been having a rough month. My room is a disaster. I didn't finish my konmari and my clothes are all over a spare bed. I can't get rid of anything and I'm just looking for a hand to hold. I wish I had someone who could help me here but no one has time for that.

Maintenance in a multi-person household,"I am eager to learn strategies of maintaining household clutter to a minimum when you and your significant other work full-time and have young kids.

I am happy with the results, but realistically I know that this is temporary. How do you maintain the blissful decluttered state so that all the work that you put in is not in vain? Do you have a schedule where you, for instance, spend two Saturdays per month fixing your environment back to how it is supposed to be?

"OMG, the momentum.","So I cleared the easy stuff from mom's oubliette.  There was a fine collection of blue wine bottles that got thrown in the recycling bin, among other things.  That bin is on a 2-week cycle and we filled it so bad that we can't get the normal household stuff out yet.

I went into the proper storage room because at some point over the summer, stuff got put into the air conditioner spot.  I pulled out everything that was in my way, including stuff that I could accidentally knock over or trip on.  (That one conditioner was heavy, and that other one wasn't easy either.)  I intended just to put everything back without thinking about it too much.  I asked my mom to look around for what needed to be put in easy-to-reach places, next thing you know, we found another carload of stuff to donate.  While the cleaning lady was in the bathroom and we were talking to her, mom also found some books in the hallway bookcase that could go.  I found a lightbulb and tried to put it in the hallway because it looked like a 2-socket fixture with one burnt-out bulb, but it was just a 1-socket.

How do you stop the obsessive decluttering?,"I've gotten the easy stuff.  I've worked to the point of burnout, rested, and then almost got to burnout again.

Using decluttering to reclaim my happiness after severe depression and the end of a long term relationship.,"In the last 4 days I have decluttered more than 17 trash bags full of random crap I was low-key hoarding over time. I have had depression basically forever, but the last year or so I was in a really bad place with my mental health and it took a huge toll on my LTR and on my emotional well-being. The last few weeks I have had random huge bursts of clarity - I am tired of being sad and unhappy with my life all the time, and a huge part of this is my hoarding-related tendency (note: I don’t think I qualify as an actual hoarder - just a very mild one lol) to keep everything “just in case, because what if I need it?” I didn’t want to feel directionless and overwhelmed and anxious about my life anymore. I wanted to cleanse myself of the unnecessary bullshit I had accumulated. I am disappointed that I got so out of control in the first place, but I am trying to heal. 

Idk what sparked this change, but I’m really glad that it happened. I still have a lot to declutter, but I was ruthless and just purged SO much! It was really emotionally exhausting at first, but I realized that my clutter collecting was a huge factor in my unhappiness. I let go of the emotional connection I had to these things - I wanted to reclaim myself after the last few years in this dark void of sadness; even though I knew this wouldn’t magically solve all my problems, it was a start. I genuinely love organization, but I was struggling because I had way too much stuff that I didn’t need, use, or want. So I bagged it all up and actually removed it from my apartment - another big step. 

Just wanted to share :) I hope everyone here is having a wonderful week as well. Be proud of little (or big!) things you accomplish, even if you have a long way to go. This was a positive first step in my journey to be healthy and happy again. Warm fuzzies to all my fellow declutter-ers, we can do it!

Breaking old habits to remain clutter-free,"Yesterday I received two packages of clothes that I ordered online.  I went through and tried everything on, ultimately I decided on returning one piece that I did not like the fit of.  This morning before work I packed it back up, printed a label and put it in the mailbox.  Done! Gone!

In the past, *too many times* I have just tossed the unloved item aside fully intending to return it but never getting around to it.  The item would just sit until it was too late and I no longer could return it, ultimately adding pointlessly to my clutter.  In fact, I found one such item in my closet last weekend and listed it for sale on Mercari this week.

Should I get rid of this fake shoe rack?,"This is kind of stupid but I'm having a hard time deciding if I should get rid of this fake shoe rack. It's actually a TV stand that i had in my old apartment. My new apartment had built-ins for the TV so I didn't need it anymore. instead of throwing it out I thought I could use it as a shoe rack. But I don't know if I really like it as a shoe rack. The way it's shaped I kind of have to nest it in the corner of my closet. ANd I feel like if I got rid of it I'd have more room on the floor for my shoes. Like I could just line them up. and it would feel more spacious in my closet without it.

Is there something else I could use it for or should I just toss it (or maybe donate it)?

Can you actually make any money from decluttering your house?,"That's a question I asked my wife when she was trying to tell me we needed to declutter. Of course, I agreed with her.

I just didn't want to mess with it. So I tried the financial argument thinking that would delay or even avoid going through this. 

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of introducing her to one of the most successful bloggers on the planet, Michelle Schroeder-Gardner at Making Sense of Cents. 

She has tons of articles on her site about saving money, getting deals on everyday things, and a whole lot of other interesting financial and non financial topics. While browsing Michelle's site, my wife came across this article, [How to Declutter Your Closet - I'm a Closet Slob](https://moneywithapurpose.com/five-tips-to-get-top-dollar-when-decluttering/). I knew I was in trouble. 

You see, she's been after me to clean out my closet for years. It's full of nice suits from my time working in banks and brokerage firms where the required attire was a suit. I don't wear them anymore. So, in my quest to slow down the declutter discussions, I poured gasoline on her fire. 

She found a lot of other articles on Michelle's site and she was off and running. What was I thinking?

From there, she did a Google search on decluttering. The list was endless. She went from the closet to the house with articles like this one - [How to Declutter Every Room in Your House](https://www.thespruce.com/decluttering-your-entire-home-2648002).

Decluttering Doesn't Always Require Getting Rid Of Stuff,"I noticed a lot of people focus on declutter by just getting rid of stuff. To be fair, that is definitely an easy and affective way to declutter because less stuff means taking up less space.

I was looking at my desk and I realized, I hated it. It was a cluttered mess. But none of the stuff I wanted to get rid of. Some of it was specifically it was parts of my computer and other stuff was just random. So here is what I did.

* I cleared everything off my desk, set it on the floor.
* I realized that the some of the computer's components which were taking up a lot of space actually would fit behind the monitor or under the screen. Specifically the sub, the BluRay Drive, and the external disk drives. Moving those components alone freed up a ton of space I didn't previously have. 
* I have a ton of cable ties from a previous project. I cable tied everything nicely. This freed up space for me to move the components behind and under the screen.
* A couple of the items just didn't belong on my desk, so I moved them to a more proper home. 
* With the space I freed up, I rearranged things in a more pleasing manner. 

My desk went from looking like a clutter pile that had been accumulating for years (which is sad because I've only had this desk setup in the house for about 8 months) to a clean, well spaced out, more functional workspace. All without having to get rid of anything. Just setting things up in a more organized manner can go a big ways towards hitting your declutter goals.

Exploring dysfunctional habbits.. 'deals' v.s 'need' and other thoughts.,"I was massively encouraged and inspired by the 'Clutter Chronicles' podcast and it got me thinking about some of my dysfunctional habbits. 


I am really wrestling with this idea of the 'thrift' 'deal' mindset. Ever since I was young, I've been wired to always search for deals and snatch them up.  I take pride in this and it feels like a part if my identity. Thrift stores, free stores, free stuff, store sales, stocking up on food and other items. I feel that I can afford anything if it is a good deal. I have never budgeted, but have always lived within my means.


My family was extremely cheap and frugal out of necessity.  They were very poor but always lived within their means and made it work. Rather then regret that I mostly embraced it, and its a source of pride for me that I can always get a great deal, or reuse and create something useful out of nothing. Now I am finding that those ingraned philosphies are really interfering with my quality of life. 


I find that I am far to emotionally attached to the high of getting a deal, the search and the purchase. Its hard for me to buy anything normal price, especially when I know it will go on sale later. Identifying as a frugal deal finder is just.. isn't there more to life?


Some 'deals' I buy simply because its too good of a deal to pass up. I have subconscious fear of not being able to afford what I need when I need it as I often refuse to buy things at full price. (Even though I have a good salary now)


 My perception of affordable and need is warped, but only recently have I really begun to see how this negatively impacts my life. I'm surrounded by clutter of many not-quite-right items that are not able to serve their purpose, or are wasted by not being used such as food, beauty products and all household items.


As a kid our entire family would go nuts and stock up on after holidiay chocolate and candy sales. As long as it was a good price per gram we could buy as much as we wanted. Yet another item we would have gone without  if it had always been full price and ultimately saved money (and had better health) I have likely spent thousands of dollars on candy, without realzing it.


When I shop for groceries I look by price per weight for good value. It's no problem buying freezer stable items like hamburger, but other items end up freezerburnt before they can be used. I just cleared out two bags of fish, vegetables, fruit and old meat that were innedible and threw it away. Money wasted, even though all of those items were a really good value per pound at the time. (Costco has some issues like this for me)


Some people will buy a package of meat for $5 and call it a deal, even though it's $40 per pound. I will buy sale meat for $3/lb and spend $45. However unless its a stable meat, and portioned properly I will eat more then I need, forget that it's in the freezer and have to re-buy or let it go to waste. $5 v.s. $45 - who spent more?


The factor I seem to be missing is identifying need. If I don't need 15lbs, buying a small portion at $40/lb is the best value that meets my needs, but I am wired to 'need' deals and often skip over rationalizing real need, usefulness, usability.

This has caused my wardrobe to be massive but have nothing to wear (since my 'clothing manifesto' project I have had alot of success in this department). There is a reason clothing reaches clearence or the thrift store.. often its colour, size, fabric, style etc. And when feeling desparate for a deal its easy to compromise on something less then suitable in the moment.


I think nickle and diming myself is more expensive, and leads to a decreased quality of life due to anxiety of sparcity and clutter.

 Recently I tested this theory, and bought 3 new crop jeans for $30 and thats all I wore this summer and fall. In past years I would have searched and and desparately bought many not quite right from the thrift. The thrift equivalent would be 22 pairs of jeans or shorts. I think the jeans will last for 2 years, given my shopping habbits, 11 pairs per year sounds about right. 3 quality pairs that match everything and fit v.s. 11 that clutter, don't fit right, is a big win.


The other issue that comes to mind is trying to sell clutter to 'make' money or not be wasteful. 



This is good for some people who's houses are full of valuable things (I knew a woman who very orgagnizedly hoarded enough new and nice things to fill 3 houses and her estate sale 'made' alot of money) 

But, for any borderline hoarder like me, trying to sell non brand name clothes, old kitchen stuff, or the voluminous amount of worthless knick knacks that tend to accumilate this is another barrier to the decluttering process. Its the nice things that are easy to sell, but that I need to keep.


The invisible, catagoryless, homeless and worthless clutter is what needs to go. Often it's too good to trash, borderline not good enough for a thrift store, unsaleble on facebook, could have a future usefullness, or is sentimental. 



I have alway been a stuff seller, why not claw back the money? However most of my stuff won't sell, or it takes copius amounts of time to offload. This has stalled my progress so much that I'm demoralized. So cluttered that it feels like life is on hold. Feel too stressed so am ignoring calls for work, still not decluttering but distracting myself on netflix, not spending leisure time productively, not sleeping well. 



If I donated everything that needed to go, and had the headspace to work, in a week I could replace all of it or buy specifics that I really need. To not work is costing me hundreds every day, for the first time in my life, working casual, my time IS money and the $20 I earn selling a knack isn't going to even compare to the 8 hours of pay I could be getting. 


I think way to hard about this stuff, maybe posting this is therapy. I hope one day I can find a functional  of dealing with these struggles in a way that does not interfere with my quality of life, and live in a healthy way, not defined by clutter or my relationship with stuff.


TL;DR I've tried KM, logic, lists, guilt, declutter rampages and clutter is still kicking my butt. It's time to investigate the deeply ingraned subconscious dysfunctional habbits and work through them. Here's to self therapy and hope for success.",declutter,1537555873,nspikeu,19,45,True,9hsxly,2018-09-21,"Exploring dysfunctional habbits.. 'deals' v.s 'need' and other thoughts. I was massively encouraged and inspired by the 'Clutter Chronicles' podcast and it got me thinking about some of my dysfunctional habbits. 


I am really wrestling with this idea of the 'thrift' 'deal' mindset. Ever since I was young, I've been wired to always search for deals and snatch them up.  I take pride in this and it feels like a part if my identity. Thrift stores, free stores, free stuff, store sales, stocking up on food and other items. I feel that I can afford anything if it is a good deal. I have never budgeted, but have always lived within my means.


My family was extremely cheap and frugal out of necessity.  They were very poor but always lived within their means and made it work. Rather then regret that I mostly embraced it, and its a source of pride for me that I can always get a great deal, or reuse and create something useful out of nothing. Now I am finding that those ingraned philosphies are really interfering with my quality of life. 


I find that I am far to emotionally attached to the high of getting a deal, the search and the purchase. Its hard for me to buy anything normal price, especially when I know it will go on sale later. Identifying as a frugal deal finder is just.. isn't there more to life?


Some 'deals' I buy simply because its too good of a deal to pass up. I have subconscious fear of not being able to afford what I need when I need it as I often refuse to buy things at full price. (Even though I have a good salary now)


 My perception of affordable and need is warped, but only recently have I really begun to see how this negatively impacts my life. I'm surrounded by clutter of many not-quite-right items that are not able to serve their purpose, or are wasted by not being used such as food, beauty products and all household items.


As a kid our entire family would go nuts and stock up on after holidiay chocolate and candy sales. As long as it was a good price per gram we could buy as much as we wanted. Yet another item we would have gone without  if it had always been full price and ultimately saved money (and had better health) I have likely spent thousands of dollars on candy, without realzing it.


When I shop for groceries I look by price per weight for good value. It's no problem buying freezer stable items like hamburger, but other items end up freezerburnt before they can be used. I just cleared out two bags of fish, vegetables, fruit and old meat that were innedible and threw it away. Money wasted, even though all of those items were a really good value per pound at the time. (Costco has some issues like this for me)


Some people will buy a package of meat for $5 and call it a deal, even though it's $40 per pound. I will buy sale meat for $3/lb and spend $45. However unless its a stable meat, and portioned properly I will eat more then I need, forget that it's in the freezer and have to re-buy or let it go to waste. $5 v.s. $45 - who spent more?


The factor I seem to be missing is identifying need. If I don't need 15lbs, buying a small portion at $40/lb is the best value that meets my needs, but I am wired to 'need' deals and often skip over rationalizing real need, usefulness, usability.

I've completed decluttering the lowest hanging fruit (YAY!); now feeling stressed about continuing the decluttering process,"Like many of you, when I started my decluttering journey, I was very motivated by helpful posts and other tips/resources (i.e., Marie Kondo, minimalism, 2 out 1 in rule, keep/donate/trash, death cleaning) that provided step-by-step methodologies to tackle this huge task. I used a combination of these tactics over the last two years and made significant progress. 

For reference, my small condo (~1000 sqft) which was left to me by my late mother (a hoarder who would stockpile things on sale) has been in 2nd degree squalor for the last 4 years. Since I've always had the luxury of time, I worked on the lowest hanging fruit first. 

- I listed items on Craigslist and eBay, and sold a box of books to Amazon. I prioritized by starting with items I thought I could sell for &gt;$50 first, then worked my way down to items &gt;$20. I let items sit online for up to 3 months (adjusting price down to $20), and I made a few thousand dollars that way. 

- I have been taking my time to eat up accumulated shelf-stable food. I still have lots of coffee to work through from having worked at Starbucks for awhile, I have two large bags of protein powder that I had bought on sale that I am still slowly working through, and some miscellaneous food gifted from family and friends, but my kitchen is becoming less cluttered. The counters look a bit cluttered since I keep the foods I'm currently working on in sight to help with progress.

- I had an assortment of different cleaning products/solutions and used up about half of them now (includes disinfecting cleaning wipes, Windex, Lysol spray, CLR spray, granite cleaner, counter polish, Comet with bleach cleaning powder, 2 gallons of white vinegar, Rain-X shower door cleaner, etc.). When I get to my last bottle, I plan to just purchase a generic multipurpose solution for cleaning since honestly most of these didn't have a significant cleaning advantage and I have little storage space so some are sitting on the open floor/counter. I've also replaced Swiffer cleaning wipes and dusters with washable cleaning clothes and dusters and am seeing if I like that.

- Somehow I had accumulated lots of body lotion. I think my mom must have bought some on sale. I've cut it down to 7 bottles of body lotion. One is an in-shower lotion, which I use nightly. One has SPF protection, which I use daily. And 2 have waterproof SPF protection which I use when swimming and at the beach. 

- I digitized old family photos. This took up a lot of time and energy, since my family had 5 large boxes of photos to sort through. But it was very helpful to go through and throw away a lot of bad photos/duplicates and all the photos that didn't include people that I currently care about (including nature shots). I still have 2 boxes of family video tapes to digitize once I have enough funds saved up to do so. 

- I had gotten rid of my unflattering and bulky dresser and bought hanging closet organizers so that I could easily visualize the clothes that I own. This has helped me a lot since when the clothes were ""out of sight, out of mind"" I didn't wear a lot of my items the tI actually liked. 

- I ordered a ThredUp bag and shipped them some my late mom's clothes (I had already donated most of my mom's stuff before hearing of ThredUp) as well as a sample variety of my own clothes. I only sent ~20 items of my own the first round to get an idea of which items would sell and pricing, and it gave me time to consider all the items I wasn't sure about letting go of. I had lost a healthy 30 lbs in the last 3 years (I had gained a ton of weight from stress in grad school), so since my weight is still fluctuating, part of the struggle is me worried if I need some items (all of the clothes are practical), since I won't be able to afford replacing that many things. My second ThredUp bag just arrived and I'm contemplating what to donate now.

I think that although I've made a lot of progress, I'm feeling overwhelmed by all that's left to do. Part of what's distressing to me is that I have limited funds so I'm not going to chuck things that I'm actually using up (i.e., food, body lotion, cleaning supplies) but are going to be taking up a lot of space for awhile. I'm also unhappy with the big-ticket home furniture/decor, and I want to buy new modern-style couches, etc. but can't justify the cost since what I have is functional. My TV area looks cluttered since the stand doesn't hide the many wires (I use some cable management solutions but it's still extremely unsightly). I spent a lot of time reading up on how to optimize space utilization in small spaces but am unhappy with the solutions that I see.

I guess I'm unsure of the point of my post. I wanted to share my progress, which I'm proud of. I don't know how helpful advice would be since I've read the standard advice multiple times and generally know what needs to be done, you know?

The Book Unhaul Challenge,"[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh3iteKLRPw)

The goal is to get rid of at least one book from each of the following categories:

A book to which you gave a low rating.

A book you changed your mind about (e.g. no longer enjoy it)

A series you know you won't complete.

A book you did not finish (DNF).

A book you have multiple copies of.

A book you'll never actually get to.

A book you bought because of the hype.

A book you bought because of the cover.

A book you don't actually know anything about.

A book you didn't buy (e.g. it was a gift).

Obviously, this challenge was designed for the Booktube crowd, which overwhelmingly reads Young Adult (where series are common), is very concerned with book aesthetics, get a lot of free books (due to  being reviewers), and commonly own multiple editions, usually because they fangirl so hard over a particular book/series/author. So I am curious as to what categories you guys would add. For me, one is definitely, ""a popular book that the library will inevitably have or is super easy to replace.""

A book you don't actually know anything about.

A book you didn't buy (e.g. it was a gift).

Obviously, this challenge was designed for the Booktube crowd, which overwhelmingly reads Young Adult (where series are common), is very concerned with book aesthetics, get a lot of free books (due to  being reviewers), and commonly own multiple editions, usually because they fangirl so hard over a particular book/series/author. So I am curious as to what categories you guys would add. For me, one is definitely, ""a popular book that the library will inevitably have or is super easy to replace."" I read a lot of small press and niche stuff that isn't easy to find in the wild.",0

Back to one box a day,"After my big decluttering spurt, I'm back to going through one or two boxes a day. A friend suggested that I move all the boxes/clutter out of the bedroom, put up the bank of shelving I had planned on putting along one wall, then put things on it as I went through the boxes, but that's sort of impossible, since there isn't room in the LR for all of the boxes. 

I actually may rent a storage unit and bring back a few boxes a week to work on instead of having them in the way. It's hard to declutter when there is no room because of the clutter. 

Sad part is, I had planned to do decluttering outside in the courtyard this winter when the dry season hits, but now the courtyard is full of plants. So now I have to sell those plants before I can do that.

Like Rosanna Rosannadana said, it's always somethin'. But I'll get there. I'm determined. I've already tossed two big black bags of garbage and sent 5 boxes off to the Veteran's charity, which is progress, even if it isn't as fast as I'd like. All progress counts.

Struggle to declutter for my big move,"Hey all, I’m new to this sub and I need advice. I’m about to start my career in the Air Force and I’m moving permanently out of my parents’ house at the end of this month. I have a nice sized house all ready for me to move into at the base, but I don’t want to bring everything I own because, well, I have a lot of clutter.

As a part of moving out I am determined to declutter my life and only bring with me what I truly want/need to. However, I am a very sentimental person and almost everything in my room holds some sort of that sentiment for me. But because of that my room is now a mess and there’s not always a place for everything. 

I think my hoarding mindset comes from my mom. She’s all about keeping stuff that holds value even if she doesn’t use it or need it (such as vintage furniture or clothes). When I try to get rid of something like, say, a childhood teddy bear my now deceased grandpa gave me, I get asked “are you sure you want to get rid of it?”, causing me to second-guess myself and then put it back in its corner of my room for my next purge. 

So I ask you, dear redditors, how do I decide what to bring, what to leave here, and what to donate/trash/sell? What kind of stuff should I keep forever because of the value it does or could hold? Any advice would be much appreciated.",declutter,1537027829,Kelikei,27,26,True,9g2n3z,2018-09-15,"Struggle to declutter for my big move Hey all, I’m new to this sub and I need advice.

Changing taste: Has decluttering changed the way you see the world around you?,"Since jumping into the world of decluttering this spring, I feel like I got a new set of eyes:

In the past, cluttered environments seemed warm or comforting and sometimes quirky. Nowadays, I feel less comfortable and more hopeful that people, including myself, will get organized.

How far is too far?,"I just discovered Condo's book about two weeks ago, and in that time I've probably eliminated 70% of my possessions. Some of these things were sentimental to me, but I decided that maybe they were memories from which I needed to move on. I live together with a family member and she is clearly disturbed with my progress, and it has been unfortunate for her to witness me remove things that she gave me. I've also destroyed a couch in order to get it out of the house easier, and she was unhappy about that, even though it did not belong to her. My question to myself lately is, 'will I regret any of this?' I mean, Condo obviously emphasizes the sense of ""joy"" we feel when we touch and meditate on an object, and I think that is vital to the progress, but it is a hedonistic component that remains unanswered for many items, because the question that naturally occurs at least for me is 'what is joy?' It is difficult to measure. Then to eliminate items down to the essentials, like one spoon, one pillow, etc., can be risky because we don't always know what we will need in the future. I mean, should I just have one bandaid? That seems excessive, because I might really need more than that when an emergency comes. 

I'm unaffiliated, though I practice some basic teachings in buddhism that have worked for me for many years, and while I think that the idea that we should remain unattached to things is essential, I am reminded that we should always live in moderation.

A reflection on decluttering very sentimental items,"I guess in writing this I hope to help someone else in a similar situation.

Yesterday I decluttered my photography gear, I shoot analog and digital so it was quite an undertaking.

Almost a decade ago when I began to express and interest in photography my stepdad generously gave me his old Canon AE-1 body with several lenses/filters/etc, his whole kit.  I used the heck out of that kit for my first year before eventually buying a digital SLR.  I still shoot with it occasionally even now for the sake of nostalgia and a change of pace.

Last week was his birthday and next month will be the second anniversary of his death.  I was fortunate to have almost 20 years with him, we were fairly close.  For years he was the biggest supporter of my photography hobby, often asking ""So have you shot anything interesting lately?""

Of course I had an initial emotional reaction to opening his camera bag, I allowed myself a moment to reflect as a spread the items out on the bed.  I came to the conclusion that he would want someone to be making use of and learn from these things (I feel the same), after all, that is the spirit in which he gave them to me.  I wiped away some tears and started to analyze.

There were a few lenses I have outgrown and filters I do not use so I packed them carefully in a box to donate in the hope that they find their way to someone that can enjoy and learn from them.  I did keep two ribbons from photography contests he won decades ago, I enjoy every time I rediscover them and they don't take up much space.

The End Result of Clutter,"I just found this sub, good info

The last week I have been cleaning out my grandmothers house. She is in the nursing home and the home needs to be sold.

She was a bit of a hoarder (lovingly) she stocked pilled anything that could be picked up cheap. Some of it was good quality stuff, and I'm sure in her mind someone in the family would eventual need a lamp or stove top or whatever.

Everything was boxed nicely and organized,  if you visited the house you would have no idea what was hidden away in the basement, or attic.

The whole family, took what they could but the vast majority of the stuff just ended up in a dumpster.

Time, and decay were not kind to many of the items in the basement.

The whole time I was carrying out ”items” it hit me that she felt this item was valuable but now it's just getting tossed out.

There was a train track, that my cousins and I were never allowed to play with as kids, mold ate away the wood and in the dumpster it went.

The last week I have been cleaning out my grandmothers house. She is in the nursing home and the home needs to be sold.

She was a bit of a hoarder (lovingly) she stocked pilled anything that could be picked up cheap. Some of it was good quality stuff, and I'm sure in her mind someone in the family would eventual need a lamp or stove top or whatever.

Everything was boxed nicely and organized,  if you visited the house you would have no idea what was hidden away in the basement, or attic.

The whole family, took what they could but the vast majority of the stuff just ended up in a dumpster.

Time, and decay were not kind to many of the items in the basement.

The whole time I was carrying out ”items” it hit me that she felt this item was valuable but now it's just getting tossed out.

There was a train track, that my cousins and I were never allowed to play with as kids, mold ate away the wood and in the dumpster it went.

What is squalor? Measuring your mess,"I found this scale on the website Squalor Survivors. If you haven't been there before, it's a very supportive site written with care and understanding. I don't have any affiliation with it. I found it last week and really liked it.

This scale helps me define my mess. For most of my life, first-degree squalor has been my baseline. Normal. I didn't know it had a name other than being disorganized, and I thought anyone more organized than me was a neat freak.

Putting a name and measurement to a mess was eye-opening-- I hope it can help someone else too.

#First degree squalor

You are getting behind in tasks that you would normally manage, like laundry and dishes. You are not the tidy person you once were. Little piles are starting to emerge and your disorganization is starting to affect your life and inconvenience you. Things are just starting to get out of hand and become unmanageable. A sign of first degree squalor could be that you might be embarrassed for other people to see your mess...but you would still let them in the house.

#Second degree squalor

Signs that you have reached second degree would include losing the use of normal household items like your bed, table, television or telephone, because the piles have expanded to cover the items up. You start to develop new methods of moving around your house, as normal movement is impeded by your piles of stuff. You might start making excuses to discourage people from entering your house.

#Third degree squalor

At this stage, you have all the above, plus you have rotting food and animal faeces and/or urine in the house, and this is the rule not the exception. You cannot cope with the growing mess. Essential household repairs may not be done, because you are too afraid to let a tradesperson see your house. Just the thought of someone seeing your mess causes you great stress.

#Fourth degree squalor

At fourth degree squalor, you have all of the above, plus you have human faeces and/or urine in your house that is not in the toilet.

Finally...

Whatever stage of squalor you are at, know two things:

1. You are not the only person to have reached this degree of squalor. 

2. Other people have been where you are...and come back. You deserve better!

Is there a checklist/plan anywhere to help people take the big step into dealing with their clutter?,"So sorry if this is frequently asked and is boring!

A marriage breakdown and lots of problems at home have led to the house becoming out of control. 

I have become so overwhelmed and depressed about it (getting help with depression though) and also suffer from extreme fatigue. I still live with a soon-to-be-ex due to financial issues and he is very shaming and reactive. He is on the spectrum so finds clutter intolerable which I try to support but his level of intolerance and contempt is very hard to deal with. I have given him the top floor of the house as his sanctuary so he can be away from the mess. So I now share a bedroom with our youngest kid. There is also an older child with complex SN who is volatile and tricky at the moment. All kid/SN/divorce issues are as under control as they can be although very much not ideal. 

It is the house and my well being that isn’t under control. 

Ex is very impulsive and reactive and when the house went from clean and tidy to just a bit untidy he became more aggressive in his speech and demeanour telling me he lived in squats better than our house. His over reaction and behaviour did make me feel very prickly and pissed off. I didn’t jump up and sort it out, I just ignored his rants as had other priorities then. Kids were bemused as well. He will just throw my stuff away and does almost nothing around the house. He regularly threatens to take everything to the refuse centre when I leave the house. I’ve found stuff in the bin often. Not rubbish - storage containers, clothes etc. If he does work around the house, like laundry it never occurs to him to wash anyone else’s clothes. If he tidies the kitchen, it is superficial. Floor not washed, out of date and off food can be left in fridge and he then bitches about it but won’t throw it away at the time and certainly never sorts out or cleans fridge. I will when throw away food I see out of date stuff. He just leaves it to me because he doesn’t want to touch it. If a pet is sick on the floor, he steps over it as he doesn’t want to do it so he won’t. He is very black/white in his thinking and has almost no empathy. 

Sorry for the essay. I wanted to give background. I really need some help clearing my bedroom. Other child’s room is ok and reasonable. So is bathroom. I just feel totally floored by my bedroom (and half if the lounge I use for a study/office/dining area but that does not upset me like my bedroom). There are bags and piles of clean washing everywhere, paperwork, luggage, books, lots of stuff with no real home. It is piling up and there is little floor space. It makes me very miserable but it seems so huge a task I never can tackle it properly. I’m so ashamed of how I have changed from being so organised and clean to a slob. 

I would never let a friend into my house - I am too ashamed. Or trades person. I think my bedroom is squalor level 2. It only isn’t 3 because There is no mouldy food or pet faeces etc around but every surface is covered and piled up and it feels so claustrophobic. I spend a lot of time in here and it is toxic for my well-being. 

How do I start to do my bedroom and keep going?I put away the kids endless washing but mine stays in piles. Then I come across stuff without homes and it just all grinds to a halt.
Is there a decluttering plan or list/schedule to follow? 

I’ve tried Konmari but nothing makes me joyful these days and it is the overwhelmingly impossible feeling of the whole task I really need to deal with. 
All drawers and cupboards are full of course. 

I’ve put on lots of weight in last few years since depressed. I have lots of very nice and new, and not cheap, but too-small clothes. I also have bigger and cheaper clothes for now too. 

I fully intend to lose weight but I know until I am not under same roof as ex and got my physical problems fixed,  it probably isn’t going to happen. I have no money now so don’t want to throw away the clothes because I can’t replace them again. The clothes I wear now aren’t the kind I could resell to finance new clothes when I lose weight. Also I was planning on ebaying some smaller clothes as they are re-sellable brands but eBay is now full of scammers and buyers are getting screwed. I used to eBay but it is far less profitable and reliable. 

I don’t want to just give them away it to charity as I could do with the money. Any alternatives to eBay around?

Please help! I think I need advice but also some kindness and reassurance I’m not a worthless, lazy fat waste of space because that is how I have been made to feel by a fair few people including ex.

I'm a recovering 3rd degree squalor survivor.,"A few days back, someone posted about the degrees of squalor on the squalor survivors website. It really resonated with me and I'd like to share my story.

I have been living in 3rd degree squalor for years. I have severe depression and anxiety. I allow messes to pile up because I don't feel like dealing with it, and then the piles get so huge, I CAN'T deal with it.

My husband is just as bad- but for him, it's more that he has sentimental value attached to all the clutter, so instead of anxiety stopping him from discarding unusable items like me, it's like getting rid of things we dont need is tantamount to disrespecting the loved ones who owned the clutter before.

A few weeks ago, just two days before my wedding (so already an insanely stressful time), I had the biggest panic attack I've ever had while doing my laundry at the laundromat. We were about to go on our honeymoon, so we we're forced to face the piles of clothes taking up space on our floor, chairs, dining room table and even coffee table. We searched through piles of clothes we needed, I started feeling overwhelmed. 

How could my honeymoon, something meant to bring joy and relaxation be causing so much anxiety?

""It's okay,"" my anxiety said. ""Just get the stuff you need for now and we'll do ALL the laundry when we grt home from the honeymoon.""

This seemed acceptable, I reasoned. I really didn't need one more thing to worry about.

But I did worry about it. While folding laundry, I became more and more aware of exactly how long I hadn't done laundry. I hadnt seen this bathing suit in 18 months, this shirt in 6 months, this pair of pants in two years.

As my then fiancee went to get more quarters, I didnt have anyone to distract me. My brain had my full attention. 

That's when it happened.

I pictured my home in my mind: 

Piles of cat urine soaked clothes in the bedroom (because the litter box is never clean), dishes that just rot all over every surface in the kitchen, garbage never taken out and spilling over into the living room and even the bathroom. Clutter and dust and random stuff everywhere. Just piles covering every surface, The only furniture open for me to use were the couch and the bed. Everything else was covered in stuff. We had managed to carve out walking paths around the clutter and vaccuumed those so it didn't feel like we were total slobs. 

But we were, I realized. Holy shit. 

Then came the spiral: I can't live like this. How did this happen? I'm a child who can't look after myself. I'm an unsuccessful adult. I am an embarrassment, a failure, a source of shame. 

I am fucking worthless.

BOOM. Panic attack. The scariest I've ever had. My head began to spin. My heart racing to the point of explosion. A high pitched whine covered my ears like a helmet 3 sizes too small. Nausea, dizziness. Holding on to the laundromat courtesy table for dear life, I tried to focus on breathing slowly like my therapist taught me while not drawing attention to myself. 

I couldn't let anyone in the laundromat know what a failure I was. What kind of a person has a panic attack in a laundromat? A failure, that's who. They would call an ambulance. And the medical professionals treating me would call my parents and then my family would know exactly how much of an embarrassing, shameful failure I was. I was still too scared of being vulnerable.

It all came crashing down around me in that laundromat and that's how my fiancee found me- clinging to a table, sweating, panjcked and dizzy. 

To his credit, he led me in a grounding exercise and got me to focus on breathing. Eventually the panic attack started to ease up. I was exhausted but we had to address the source of the panic.

I made my now husband promise we were going to get our lives together or I had to leave and fix myself. I couldn't calculate the amount of torture I was putting myself in while living like this and it had to stop. 

That conversation was the hardest we've ever had. We talked through it all. Every issue with our relationship. Every source of pain, stress or embarrassment. We ended up making vows to eachother right there in the laundromat. We made a plan.

I called for reinforcements. The next day, a friend who loves to clean (and also loves me and wanted to help) was in my kitchen doing the dishes while my fiancee and I did a mass clean in our home. By the end of the day, our home wasn't clutter free, but a sizable dent had been made in the mess and we left for our wedding and honeymoon feeling better. 

Since returning, we started out okay, but then fell into some old habits. So we hired an organization and declutter specialist to help. She is such a positive force in our lives, and she explains things in ways where there is no blame and reference to how we were before, but practical solutions and black and white ""assign everything a place"" attitude. I also subscribed to this sub and reading others' experiences, trials and triumphs has lessened the feeling of being a failure. 

I'm learning to be kinder to myself and to stop thinking that I'm a failure for living with depression and anxiety. Carrying around that burden bogged me down so much, it was impossible to live with it and so I created misery around me to match the misery inside.

Right now we aren't where I want to be, but I keep myself grounded by repeating my new mantra, change doesn't happen overnight. As long as we chip away at our clutter issues and keep working towards the clutter's eventual transition into workable living space, we will get there. 

And we are healing. I feel so much more positive about my life and instead of feeling overwhelmed, I feel empowered. I want to keep working at it. I want to have a home that I'm proud of. I want to have a functional living space that brings me comfort and peace.

I'm a work in progress, but for the first time in my life, I'm not scared of the work. I'm excited by it. 

For those lurkers on this sub, desperate for help, but too scared or anxious to do anything about it, I see you. I love you. You are valued and important and I know you can do this. Share your vulnerability. Ask for help. I know it's hard. But only after you ask for help and shoe vulnerability can healing begin. 

With love,

""It's okay,"" my anxiety said. ""Just get the stuff you need for now and we'll do ALL the laundry when we grt home from the honeymoon.""

This seemed acceptable, I reasoned. I really didn't need one more thing to worry about.

But I did worry about it. While folding laundry, I became more and more aware of exactly how long I hadn't done laundry. I hadnt seen this bathing suit in 18 months, this shirt in 6 months, this pair of pants in two years.

As my then fiancee went to get more quarters, I didnt have anyone to distract me. My brain had my full attention. 

That's when it happened.

I pictured my home in my mind: 

Piles of cat urine soaked clothes in the bedroom (because the litter box is never clean), dishes that just rot all over every surface in the kitchen, garbage never taken out and spilling over into the living room and even the bathroom. Clutter and dust and random stuff everywhere. Just piles covering every surface, The only furniture open for me to use were the couch and the bed. Everything else was covered in stuff. We had managed to carve out walking paths around the clutter and vaccuumed those so it didn't feel like we were total slobs. 

But we were, I realized. Holy shit. 

Then came the spiral: I can't live like this. How did this happen? I'm a child who can't look after myself. I'm an unsuccessful adult. I am an embarrassment, a failure, a source of shame. 

I am fucking worthless.

BOOM. Panic attack. The scariest I've ever had. My head began to spin. My heart racing to the point of explosion. A high pitched whine covered my ears like a helmet 3 sizes too small. Nausea, dizziness. Holding on to the laundromat courtesy table for dear life, I tried to focus on breathing slowly like my therapist taught me while not drawing attention to myself. 

I couldn't let anyone in the laundromat know what a failure I was. What kind of a person has a panic attack in a laundromat? A failure, that's who. They would call an ambulance. And the medical professionals treating me would call my parents and then my family would know exactly how much of an embarrassing, shameful failure I was. I was still too scared of being vulnerable.

It all came crashing down around me in that laundromat and that's how my fiancee found me- clinging to a table, sweating, panjcked and dizzy. 

To his credit, he led me in a grounding exercise and got me to focus on breathing. Eventually the panic attack started to ease up. I was exhausted but we had to address the source of the panic.

I made my now husband promise we were going to get our lives together or I had to leave and fix myself. I couldn't calculate the amount of torture I was putting myself in while living like this and it had to stop. 

That conversation was the hardest we've ever had. We talked through it all. Every issue with our relationship. Every source of pain, stress or embarrassment. We ended up making vows to eachother right there in the laundromat. We made a plan.

I called for reinforcements. The next day, a friend who loves to clean (and also loves me and wanted to help) was in my kitchen doing the dishes while my fiancee and I did a mass clean in our home. By the end of the day, our home wasn't clutter free, but a sizable dent had been made in the mess and we left for our wedding and honeymoon feeling better. 

Since returning, we started out okay, but then fell into some old habits. So we hired an organization and declutter specialist to help. She is such a positive force in our lives, and she explains things in ways where there is no blame and reference to how we were before, but practical solutions and black and white ""assign everything a place"" attitude. I also subscribed to this sub and reading others' experiences, trials and triumphs has lessened the feeling of being a failure. 

I'm learning to be kinder to myself and to stop thinking that I'm a failure for living with depression and anxiety. Carrying around that burden bogged me down so much, it was impossible to live with it and so I created misery around me to match the misery inside.

Right now we aren't where I want to be, but I keep myself grounded by repeating my new mantra, change doesn't happen overnight. As long as we chip away at our clutter issues and keep working towards the clutter's eventual transition into workable living space, we will get there. 

And we are healing. I feel so much more positive about my life and instead of feeling overwhelmed, I feel empowered. I want to keep working at it. I want to have a home that I'm proud of. I want to have a functional living space that brings me comfort and peace.

I'm a work in progress, but for the first time in my life, I'm not scared of the work. I'm excited by it. 

For those lurkers on this sub, desperate for help, but too scared or anxious to do anything about it, I see you. I love you. You are valued and important and I know you can do this. Share your vulnerability. Ask for help. I know it's hard. But only after you ask for help and shoe vulnerability can healing begin. 

With love,

What to do with handmade clothing?,"Hi all! I really struggle with getting rid of things, but I want to declutter my life.

Finally made progress on my clutter,"First, PLEASE don't tell me to donate everything I saved to sell. It's my choice how to get rid of my stuff, and it's mean to chastise someone whose motivation you don't even know.

Someone is giving me some furniture, and I need to do a fast 4-day declutter to make room for it. I certainly don't have the time or space to do the entire room, but I made a small dent today. Sorry, no pics, because it's not something very noticeable yet, but here's what I did.

Went through 15 boxes of ""stuff"". Some of the boxes were only partially full. Ended up with

- 3 large boxes of donations.

- 4 boxes of stuff my friend and I are taking to the flea market next weekend (whatever doesn't get sold gets donated the next day)

- 3 boxes of ""keep."" I'm doing this fast, so I'm going to go back through ""keeps"" after the first run through all the boxes and purge further.

- 1 box of papers I'm going to go through and declutter tonight while watching TV

- 1 large black garbage bag full of trash

- Also, took four old dresser drawers I picked up 3 years ago to make a shelving unit out of, and never did, BACK out to the dumpster. I hated to do it, because they are nice drawers; dovetailed and nice wood, but if I haven't done it in 3 years, I'm not going to. People are always tossing out dressers around here, so no great loss.

My back gave out, and I live in a small apartment, so there is no room to do more until I get these boxes re-organized in the other room.

I am also putting some stuff on Craigslist, like furniture and sporting equipment, which will free up quite a bit of room. 

I have some Christmas stuff, two artificial trees and some lights and decorations, that I can't donate because they don't take Christmas stuff until I think November, so I'm just going to give those away for free on Craigslist. 

I'm sort of proud of myself. I've been putting this off for 3 years, so this is big progress for me.

Realization!,"Hello!  First post.  


I just realized that, with my father-in-law's passing in February, I have been cleaning up a 4th degree squalor situation!  Having watched his house descend into decrepitude over several years, the severity of his situation (which he fought to keep that way!) finally dawned on me.  Every time I visited I offered to clean anything, take some trash to the dump, anything.  He fought me every time.  Not physically.  


Once he passed, I chased out the squatters/tweakers who were the real cause of the squalor.  Local sheriffs were extremely helpful with this step!  No one was arrested (unfortunately) or shot (almost!)   


The property is about 90 minutes from me, and 15 miles from the nearest small town.  So any needed tools or equipment have to be carefully planned.  


Last month, with the help of friends, we filled a 40' roll-off dumpster with trash and disinfected the house.

Even when we can move things, we need to reduce stuff by two thirds if the house is going to be tidy and accessible to visitors. 

I suppose the key word in that is *overwhelming* \- we have both been so overwhelmed by the whole situation we have done nothing about it for most of that time.

Most of that stuff is useless, I don't read those books, I never use those CD (in fact my DVD reader is sitting unused in my pc tower for years!!!), and many gifts that are useless, you know the classic scenario in which a friend gives you some random stuff you won't never use, but feel sorry about throwing it off. (what if they notice you did?)

I think books are the most problematic: they take too much space but I feel like shit when I think of getting rid of them. Its somehow a cultural thing, in my family and in my country, books are overvalued and they should NEVER be trashed, as books are holy knowledge (even if its just a novel LOL).

"Apps for decluttering CD’s, DVD’s, etc.","There may have been posts about this before, but if not, there are some good apps for those who have uploaded their digital media to a hard drive and would like to get rid of it for a little bit of cash. 

I am tinkering with two different ones right now, DECLUTTR and BONAVENDI. They both allow barcode scanning to get a price and believe both can give you a free shipping label to print. You won’t get a lot for individual items. I have some CD’s that came up $3, but most are around a dollar or less. 

You can also sell old tech items like cameras, phones, etc. There are also other apps that can be found with a simple google search as well as written reviews of different ones.

"This weekend, take ""The Purge"" decluttering challenge and free yourself from 90% of things that don't make you happy or productive.","This mission will take a full day of your time, and potentially even two. This makes it a great weekend project. Add it to your calendar and take it seriously: open the windows, crank up the music, and keep the TV off. Let’s roll.

## STEP ONE: OUTLINE EVERY SECTION OF YOUR LIFE IN A LIST

Everyone is different, but many of us share common sections of our lives. Here's an excellent starting point for this list. Remember, your mind, body, and life are all included in the decluttering purge. Customize this list by adding or removing sections relevant to you.

**LIFE**

Clothing

Kitchen

Furniture

Bedroom

Bathroom

Phone

Computer

Car

Career

Finances

Schedule

Desk

Community

Adventure

**BODY**

Nutrition

Flexibility

Strength

Speed

Skills

**MIND**

Goals

Spirituality

Reading

Relaxation

Creativity

Reflection

Learning

How does your list look? If you have kids, you might have to add in additional rooms. If you are living with family, you might not have as much control over the home. This list may seem overwhelming at first, but with an entire day you’d be amazed at how far you can go.

## STEP TWO: GET A GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP AND START WORKING THROUGH THE LIST

Here’s how the purge really works:

**1.** Gather

**2a**. Eliminate

**2b.** Eliminate AGAIN

**3.** **Clean &amp; Organize**

Let’s use an example. Everyone has a bedroom, so we will start there. In the gather phase, make a mess. Take it all out of your closet, empty your drawers, and throw it all on your bed or in the center of the room.

Now, eliminate. And seriously, eliminate. Marie Kondo, author of “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up”, says to pick up every single item and hold it in your hands. If it does NOT bring you true, deep-down JOY, toss it. If you haven’t worn it in a month, toss it (or donate it of course, but put it in bag and put it in your trunk. Don’t hang it back up saying I’ll donate this later). Even if it has a little sentimental value, does it really make you happy to own it?

## I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF 90% OF THE THINGS YOU OWN.

And after that, eliminate again. I guarantee there was something you were on the fence about, and decided to keep. Go through it one more time, and try and throw out a few more things.

Finally, clean &amp; organize. Vacuum the carpet and wipe down the furniture before putting things back. Each thing needs a place. One shelf for your books, one section of your closet for your shirts, one tub for your sports equipment. Then, take a moment to survey your kingdom, and move onto the next section.

So, how does this work for more intangible things? For your goals or your learning, the process is exactly the same. Write down a huge list of the things you want to accomplish. Take out what isn’t going to help you live a happier and healthier life, and combine the things that could work together.

Then, pick just ONE goal to start working towards each day, and organize your schedule to find a place for your habit. Choose just a few meals to pre-cook on Sunday for grab-and-go through the week. Write down a strength metric like pullups on a whiteboard, and just do one more every single day.

Get through ALL of this in a weekend. Imagine flopping down on the couch on Sunday night with everything in order.

## STEP THREE: CAREFULLY VET EACH NEW THING THAT COMES INTO YOUR LIFE

The Purge is a one time thing, but becoming minimalist is a lifestyle. Every day, there are more commercials, more promotional products, more coupons, more entertainment, more decorations. You’ve got to be a ruthless gatekeeper for your life.

There are a few cool hacks to make this process of vetting a little easier. When online shopping or in a physical store for a high end item, don’t buy it that day. Walk out of the store, sleep on it, and see how you feel tomorrow. Buy quality products that you will take care of and don’t need to replace often. Feel comfortable saying no to social or work engagements that will make you feel too busy or not able to be your best.

"We live in my grandparents old house, and now it’s time to clean out the last room","How do I best get rid of the garbage and clutter from this last room without causing my mom to have a heart attack? 

My mother wanted it left as is, but we have a kid on the way and need the space.

I don’t want to hurt her, but I feel like if I don’t take care of it, it’s never going to get done and everything in there will just continue to rot / mold / disintegrate.

Help Letting Go of Gifts,"Hello, fellow declutterers! I'm hoping you can help me through my current decluttering struggle. I've had a long journey so far, but I've finally managed to get through the ""but I could still use this!"" phase and have begun to feel refreshed by the act of seeking out items I can pass on to people who need them more than I do.

However, I'm still stuck on gifts. Items I'll never use, clothes I'll never wear, things I don't even necessarily like all that much.

My process of decluttering arts/crafts supplies,"I took inventory in google docs: [https://imgur.com/a/ALOLhY0](https://imgur.com/a/ALOLhY0) (although, in hindsight, excel/sheets would've been better)

1. **List the hobbies you can think of off the top of your head, mark which are most meaningful/important** (highlighted in blue)
2. **Find everything you have, sort it, add to list** (I split this into 4 groups \[art, art tools, crafts, fiber crafts\] because of the amount I own)
3. **Add hobbies/mediums you forgot about** (for me, this was certain types of paint, screenprinting, shrinky dinks)
4. **Identify unfinished projects and decide which to finish/let go of.** Frogged a sweater that was 3/4ths done. Realized I was knitting it just to get it done, and it brought me no joy. So I let go of it.
5. **Finished projects.** Gift them. Donate them. Use them. Display them. Created things aren't created to be inert. Do something with the things you make. You breathed life into it, don't let it sit in a box in your closet gathering dust. If so, might as well trash them. (Gotta admit, I really super struggle with this, so this is more to yell at myself than advice for others) 
6. **Discard** or, equally important, **don't buy anything new and use up what you have first.** This becomes a vicious cycle when you have to buy more supplies to use up certain supplies. So, this is kinda a gray area. Discretion is necessary based on your personal lifestyle, and how much arts/crafts are part of your life. During this process, I rediscovered old hobbies I enjoyed, and some that I let go of as soon as my work-in-progress was finished (bead-weaving, for me). I have some hobbies I still keep, just to cycle back to once in a while.
7. **Organize.** But, you really have to organize as you go, because with crafting comes so much STUFF that you can't really take care of it in one fell swoop. When storing supplies, store the more meaningful/important ones in easily accessible places. That way, there's no excuse for not being creative. I love making stuff, but in the grip of depression, I make so many excuses, so this is a small way to coerce myself out of my funks. 
8. **Keep creating, now with more focus, less guilt.**

This process is a WIP for me, so I greatly appreciate any pointers/tips.

Seeking honest feedback for a declutter/household management advice I provide,"Hello all!  I have been posting to this board (and responding to others posts) for several weeks now and I'm hoping the community might be willing to give me some advice.

I'm an organizational/life hacks blogger and, before anyone takes offense,  I don't make a living as a blogger and I am not advertising my blog with this post.  My main purpose for blogging is helping others while I'm learning new things and improving myself.  I don't claim to be a declutter expert, but as a 49 year old woman who has raised children and dealt with a truly cluttered home, if my experiences can be of any assistance to anyone else than I consider it worthwhile.

That out of the way, the reason for THIS post is improving the quality of the info I am providing for others.  I value this community and I am looking for **constructive** criticism.  For those of you who have read some of my posts from other discussions here ([www.midliferevelations.com](https://www.midliferevelations.com)), would you be willing to let me know what your thoughts are?  I welcome anything you have to say, but some of the questions I'm really hoping to get some insight on are:

* Do you find the household management posts to be accurate, helpful, and easy to read?  
* Is the content valuable or am I putting out material that is cliche' or common sense?
* Do you feel encouraged to leave comments?  I don't get many comments and I want to encourage folks to share their experience or ask for help.

"Decluttering your ""old self""/items that remind you of what could have been?","I'm moving in with a friend next week. I've gotten pretty overwhelmed by seeing how much stuff I've accumulated in three years of living here, so I've been purging a lot of stuff while packing and plan to purge more once I've moved. I'm a very ""out of sight, out of mind"" person, so I think having everything packed up in a way that I can't see it until I open the boxes will help me a lot.

I'm already mentally making a list of things I plan to downsize, and part of that is the often-mentioned ""fantasy self"" stuff, but also the... ""old self"" stuff, I guess you could call it? I've changed a lot in the past few years and I want the belongings I keep to reflect who I am now. I hit an obstacle when it comes to my cookbooks, though. Cooking is something I really enjoy, to the point where I wanted to make a career out of it. I even went to culinary school and everything. Unfortunately, an ever-worsening case of Crohn's disease made it harder and harder to handle the work environment of kitchens and the stress that comes with it (the more stressed I am, the more sick I get, on top of the usual shenanigans the illness likes to pull on me), and after only four years in the field, I've had no choice but to move away from it so I can make a proper recovery. (Even after recovery/remission, returning to kitchens might not be an option due to how long I've been sick and how severe my case is. My specialist says that the more I can avoid stress, the better it is for me in the long run.)

I still enjoy cooking regardless, but as much as I want to keep them all, the stash of cookbooks reminds me too much of what could have been, I guess, and it's kinda depressing to think about. I've been thinking about just taking my favourite recipes from each of them and then getting rid of them, or just keeping my favourite books, but I don't really know. I have quite a lot, I've honestly lost count of how many I own. Maybe having them packed away for a while will help me decide. I have a big collection of recipes on my computer too, but it doesn't bother me as much as the cookbooks do... probably because the cookbooks are tangible objects and take up so much physical space.

"""Decluttering"" cat feeding area: anyone have an elegant solutions?","Hey all!

So I'm in the process of decluttering my room and there's one big, glaring issue that I'm having trouble finding a solution for. My cat (1 of 5 in the household) only eats wet food, as she's picky and I'm trying to get her to gain weight. I'm currently feeding her regularly in my bedroom, with a bowl on the dresser. It's smelly, a bit messy, and overall doesn't look great. 

To preemptively answer a few question: yes, she does have to be fed in my room because my family is grossed out by the wet food and I need to close the door to stop the other cats from getting at her food. We also have two dogs, so the bowl can't be down low where they could get at it as well.

Has anyone here done it and have some candid thoughts and feedback they could share?,"I keep seeing [the becoming minimalist's 'Uncluttered Course'](https://my.becomingminimalist.com) on my facebook feed, and it looks appealing. I like the becoming minimalist group a lot, and when I did the big initial Konmari purge a few years ago it felt amazing. I'm much more minimalist in general now, and would be interested in trying their course. However, it sounds like a big part of the 'course' is just getting a daily or weekly email forwarded to you, and the price tag seems really steep to me for that (over $100 Canadian) type of a 'course'. Has anyone else here taken the course? Did you feel like what you got out of it justified the price tag?

Sorry, I guess I'm just on a really tight budget over here and having a difficult time trying to imagine how I would get together $100 to start with, never mind how I might end up feeling to find out I paid all that to get a weekly email with a link to an inspirational youtube video I could likely find for free...",declutter,1535579089,jennaflores,11,29,True,9bdlk7,2018-08-29,"Is Becoming Minimalist's 'Uncluttered' course worth the $100 price tag?

"Shoutout to my local junk hauling guy, and maybe there's someone doing the same kind of job in your area?","I saw an ad in a social media group (it was Nextdoor but it could have been Facebook) for a small moving company who would be doing a ""junk haul run"" in my neighborhood.

Culling wardrobe &amp; the number of items,"Hi all. I've been culling my wardrobe over the past few years and I have managed to donate/sell nearly 70% of it.

I did a moderate purge in March of this year, but I still have a lot of stuff. It's mixed with wanted stuff and I've had to resort to putting it all into boxes for speed and simplicity. I don't want unwanted stuff coming into my new place, but it might have to for the time being.

Using vloggers as inspiration?,"Okay hear me out. This is sort of a declutter and depression hybrid post. I fell into a deep depression and eventually moved back home. I realized I just lost the will to clean my house, keep it decluttered, and do my daily routines.  I have a hard time maintaining regular routines and self-care.

lately I've been watching these Vlogs by models and trying to emulate them. They have really minimalist homes, they have a really good diet when they wake up, and I mean I don't know how honest these routines are, but some of them even tell you what time they do their dishes. They open up their closets and you can see  how they organize. They go and wash their face and show you their products. they have what they need and it's really orderly. 

I know that they're trying to portray an image and it's not probably a hundred percent true. I don't hold myself to the standards, I just try to watch and learn.

A mountain of containers are finally gone!,"Does anyone else have a problem with saving containers? I know I picked up the habit from my Mom.

I open the door to try to take one of the few I do use out and more times than not I'm showered in random containers and lids that don't even belong together. Then I have try to stuff them all back up there and get the door shut before they start to fall out again. It's hard to stack them neatly because I can't really reach (I'm a wheelchair user) so sometimes I even resort to trying to toss lids into empty spaces! Logically, I know I'll never need all of them but I always seem to convince myself that I do. For example, I've used those frozen dinner containers with the plastic strainer section to propagate succulents before and they are great for it but instead of saving five or six of them (which would be plenty) I now have a massive collection!

Overwhelmed After Major Wright Loss,"So as the title says I am extremely overwhelmed by my clothing now that I’ve lost a little more than 100 lbs. I am looking for everyone’s best advice/tips/tough love I can get. 

I had gastric sleeve surgery in January and have since lost so much weight my clothes are all over the place. Both in size and my house! My husband and I are buying our first home and we will be moving in the next few months and I simply cannot take this baggage with me. I have clothes in just about every room in our townhouse that range from size 22-12 at this point. 

I have more clothes that do not fit me than do now, but do not want to buy anything else without getting rid of things. I have already taken 3 contractor bags full to Goodwill but still am stuffed to the gills with clothes. 

I am starting to think the best way to do this would be to try on things and start by keeping everything I know fits and then just purging the rest? It seems to have no end - a black hole of fat clothes. I need to get rid of them, emotionally and physically so I don’t have to move them.

Creating my own declutter challenge,"I've spent the past few weeks browsing various blogs, etc. getting ideas for how to declutter my home.  The problem is, these challenges don't take into consideration the level of clutter I'm dealing with!  The concept of decluttering an entire room at a time seems overwhelming.  Not saying my house isn't clean, but I'm dealing with tons of ""stuff"" from family members (not to mention my own years of hording junk).  I did get some good ideas from these sites (so I appreciate that) but I need a system that tackles one task at a time and practice maintaining that change before moving on to the next piece of the puzzle.  Ultimately, I began working on my own 52 Week Clutter Busters Challenge.

First off, let me reiterate this challenge was created for me.  I didn't set out to create a system that would drive other people to my blog or make money in any way.  It simply occurred to me that if I'm doing this for myself, perhaps there are others out there with the same next level clutter issues that might benefit from it.  There is NOTHING to buy (unless you count the organizational items I'll be suggesting but those are purchased by you from Wal-Mart, etc. at your own discretion).  

Every week I take a small task, create a checklist, and write a post on how I'm going about accomplishing it.  Be warned, I am NOT a hyper-organized person who has to slap a label on everything.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that; however, my approach is to find something practical, easy-to-use, and gets the job done with minimal effort.  If you're looking for something more intricate, this might not be the challenge for you.

I'm not an expert so feel free to use anything that works for you and discard anything that doesn't.  If that's something that appeals to you, visit [http://www.midliferevelations.com/declutter-week1/](http://www.midliferevelations.com/declutter-week1/) and get started with me.  I'm inviting anyone to leave comments with things they would like to see in the challenge (i.e. how to declutter the ""leaning tower of Tupperware"", etc.).

Downsizing Strategies,"I'm single. Older.  Have accumulated a ridiculous amount of stuff I want shed.

I moved a few years ago, from one apartment to another in the same building, and that forced me to go through a lot of things. It was unnecessarily painful and exhausting, but good for me!

Now I'm considering a dramatic resize, because I want to stop renting and buy a condo. I've fallen in love with a beautiful but impractical place.  I'd be going from about 800 square feet to 600, but also losing a lot of storage, since it's an open floor plan without the utility room I currently have, and far less closet space.

I moved a few years ago, from one apartment to another in the same building, and that forced me to go through a lot of things. It was unnecessarily painful and exhausting, but good for me!

Now I'm considering a dramatic resize, because I want to stop renting and buy a condo. I've fallen in love with a beautiful but impractical place.  I'd be going from about 800 square feet to 600, but also losing a lot of storage, since it's an open floor plan without the utility room I currently have, and far less closet space.

The dreaded recliner.,"OMFG, I hate this thing so much.  It is a Lazyboy from before that innovation where they made the chair sectional so it was easy to fit through doorways.  I could forgive the black pleather or leather because it reminds me of this one chair I liked from 1979. 

It was given to us by my uncle, who was gifted it by his aunt.  If furniture were proper heirlooms, we'd be hauling around a cabinet CRT that couldn't do coax. 

The mechanism is worn out and we can't bodge the repair.  The footrest works, but the recline mechanism requires the person to flex their abs the entire time they want to lay back.  You fall asleep, you're sleeping upright.  My mom's Lazyboy from the 90's were comfortable all night unless it was winter and you forgot to put a quilt under you.  (They're not around anymore, just worn out.)

I'd settle for getting the chair to some hipster that would either settle with its flaws or get it fixed, but I'd rather watch it get set on fire.

For reference, I was in love with the couch but agreed with my husband that it should be thrown on the curb.  (The subject of fire didn't come up, but I think he was uninterested and I would have been okay with it.)

Saving a Plasma TV box,"I live in a small apartment. One thing I would love to get rid of is the original shipping box that came with my plasma TV.

The issue is plasma TVs are very difficult to ship as they have a glass front and you they are meant to be shipped up right.

I put something on eBay for the first time in years!,"Hi everyone!

First, just to say hello - I've just discovered this sub and it looks like an awesome place to be :)

I'm overwhelmed by stuff. I've taken some steps in the last six months to have more intelligent storage and put some things on Freecycle but what I really need is to get more ruthless.

I also keep getting hampered by a long term medical condition which also means I can't drive (people coming to pick stuff up from my place is absolutely ideal - I love it when Freecycle works!!).

I'm on another period of sickness and stuck at home. Due to noisy neighbours outside I want to move my bed into another room, but the stuff problem is going to make this more difficult. I set up the futon in the new room to test the noise levels and realised I was basically sleeping in a pile of stuff :(

I have some hockey kit I've not used in years which is still perfectly serviceable. I don't know why I've been hanging onto it - maybe the memories of being more well? Maybe hoping I'd use it again? But this morning I discovered how easy it was to list it on eBay, and it's up.

It might sound a bit daft but I think this might be a real breakthrough. I wish I was well enough to leap up and keep the ball rolling but it this sells I will at least have some more space 😊

weekend task: cleaning the bedroom!,"My story: I'm back at home for a few weeks after living abroad for 2 years. I'm in my home country to sort out a visa, and then returning to China at the end of the month. While I've been home, by bedroom has turned into a disaster zone. You'd honestly think that a mini-earthquake came through and only impacted one room in the whole house... 

I blame some of it on jetlag, and other stuff on me being busier than normal and not paying attention to the mess that I've been making. Since I'm not living in my parent's home full-time, it's really easy to see this room as a landing space and to just drop things at the end of the day. But... this means that I've got a LOT to tidy up this weekend, since I'm sick of being surrounded by half unpacked boxes, laundry baskets of clean clothing that needs to be put away, etc. 

Anyone want to join me on a weekend-long cleaning and decluttering spree? I know that large-scale purges aren't long-term solutions, and that the real fix would be for me to stop being a slob... but I think that kickstarting some decluttering would do me good.

Laundry Clutter,"I don't know if you guys are like me at all, but sometimes I fall behind on laundry so badly the pile starts to take the shape of a person when the lights are out (lol, talk about jump scares).  I put quite a bit of time into a laundry guide for my readers and since I adore the clutter board so much, i wanted to give you guys the quick &amp; dirty on how I get laundry clean and stay organized.  Please feel free to add your own thoughts!  I always need advice.

**Presorting is Your Savior:**  If you can get your hands on a laundry sorter, do it.  Once a day, I go into my laundry room and sort any new laundry that has made it's way into the hamper.  I turn everything right-side-out and empty pockets.  I then place them into the appropriate bin based on my personal sorting system.  This is SO MUCH NICER than digging through a big pile containing week-old crusty underwear.  Just grab a sorting bag when it's full and launder appropriately.

**Avoid Ironing Like the Plague:**  I hate to iron...seriously.  I'd rather to scrubbing dried nastiness off the side of a toilet than iron.  I have a system that lets me avoid ironing 95% of the time.  The basic idea is...don't procrastinate.  As soon as the dryer buzzer goes off, get to folding, hanging, etc.  Don't leave clean, dry laundry crumpled in a pile.  There are tricks to ""save"" it if allowed to wrinkle, but it's much easier to just tackle it immediately.  If you've got a load that just isn't drying fast enough, I recommend tossing in a clean, fluffy towel.  It's amazing how fast clothing dries.  Be warned; however, that lint-grabbing material (like socks) may not appreciate a towel in their midst.  I don't recommend doing it unless  you need to get something dry ASAP.

**The culprit of faded/dingy looking clothes:**  If your clothes are fading fast, it may have nothing to do with how you sort them (I personally don't sort by color but use another method entirely).  Are you using hot water on clothing?  If so, that's probably the culprit.  Also, if you have a high efficiency machine and you aren't using HE detergent, you're creating a lot of suds that ends up dulling or adding a residue.  It goes without saying that stains should be pre-treated before going into the wash and never put a stained item in the dryer.  I've done it before and have yet to save something once the stain is set (unless it's white and I can bleach the crap out of it).

Hope this has helped!  If you want to see my full article, head on over to Mid-Life Revelations ([http://www.midliferevelations.com/laundry-guide/](http://www.midliferevelations.com/laundry-guide/)).

Decluttering with grandparent,"I've been on my own decluttering journey for some time, having moved twice in the past 5 years with little kids in tow. I've discovered how much extra stuff just drags us down and I don't have much attachment to things.

Now I have the task of moving a grandparent for the second time in 2 years and the new dwelling is much smaller. There is left over resentment from the last move (it was 110 degrees, no A/C and I had limited childcare and patience. Not to mention I'd helped them move years back and its a hard road if you let them manage the process). I could have done better, and want to now. 

I understand that at my grandparents age there is a strong attachment to things as representing their memories and accomplishments. But at some point people tire of moving and cleaning these things when the owner of things can't do it. Anyone have advice for helping make the declutter process go smoothly? Or should we just suggest a storage unit for what doesn't fit and let them carry the financial burden of these memories? I don't think anyone wants the stuff or I'd ask them to take it, but telling the grandparent that makes them feel their life doesn't matter if no one wants it.

Don't save things for your grandkids.,"My in-laws are approximately level two hoarders. Somehow after many decades of living like this MIL has started going through some things in their basement. What has she found? Boxes and boxes of clothes, toys, books etc. that they saved from their own kids to pass on to their grandkids someday. Well, that day has finally come!

Except, unfortunately, they waited too long so the clothes are all too small (not to mention vastly out of style). The toys are worn and broken and not things that my kids are interested in. The books are very old-fashioned and musty.

I appreciate the thought very much and it was a bit fun for us to go through the things and see what my husband wore and played with as a boy. Ultimately, however, everything ended up donated or trashed except a few things my husband kept for his own sentimental value.

Now, they have saved and stored these boxes for forty years. They have been shipped across the ocean and moved again across the continent. It was all a waste. They weren't very excited to give us the old musty boxes and we weren't very excited to receive them. 

Don't do this. *Maybe* keep one small box of very precious items if you are absolutely compelled to save things for the distant future. Store them properly, and know that they probably won't mean as much to the person you're saving them for as they meant to you.

Fast Start Declutter,"Just wanted to share a tip I have found helpful when it feels difficult to get started. I pick a room (in my case the living room) where I spend the most time and declutter by moving everything that doesn't belong in that room out.  In my case that means the TV, DVDs, Alexa, remotes, couch, chairs, pillows etc can stay, but that the random items without a place to live that have been plopped down over time have to go.  It's amazing how something without a place to live can just hang out on the TV stand for five or more months (looking at you air pump).  Why?  

Then I take those items to another area to sort and deal with later.  While I still will need to deal with them, this process helps me at least reclaim one room  to enjoy.  Then I eventually move into each subsequent room and do the same. I prioritized the kitchen, the bathroom and the master bedroom.  That left the guest room and the office a bit cluttered but as I regained the space it made it easier to tackle the rest and I was more ruthless with what I got rid of. 

Your mileage may vary, but I thought I would share in case someone is looking for a way to get started and feeling overwhelmed.

"How much is enough, and how do you deal with a valid fear of not being able to replace something?","I'm trying to declutter and de-hoard but can't decide how much is the right about to keep.


How do you get over the fear of ""If I get rid of this and then later I need it and can't afford to replace it, I'm screwed.""?




I lived through extreme poverty when I was much younger, and now after a brutal divorce I am back to square one; I lost almost everything. 








I do not make enough money to get by. I work two 40-hour-a-week jobs, have no hobbies, and spend literally no money on myself, at all. No TV, no internet, no entertainment, no cell plan, no money spent on clothes, nothing.   When I don't have to work, I sleep, and in the rare event I'm not sleeping, I go for a walk or I just sit in my apartment and think.   




I get groceries and toiletries free from the grocery store where I work, by taking damaged food I'm supposed to throw out (eg., a dozen eggs with one broken egg in the carton; canned or jarred goods with torn labels; veggies that have an expiration date that night; a 12-pack of toilet paper that someone tore the plastic open on; etc.).


Here is my dilemma:


When I have the opportunity to get something cheap or free, I stock up, because I literally don't know when I will be able to get more of that item. 



But how much is enough? 


At work we got rid of some shampoo recently, for the first time in a year. Someone with a pallet jack damaged three boxes of shampoo, breaking some of them and spilling shampoo all over the other undamaged bottles in each box.  I took them all and wiped them off.


Now I have 28 bottles of shampoo. That will last me a very long time. But the thing is, it is unknown when I will get more. Maybe next week it will happen again and the store will be throwing out more shampoo. Or maybe not for two years.


Sometimes this clearly pays off.  For example, once I got dozens of cans of soup. Over the course of a year, I ate them all and it saved me a lot of money. I'm glad I took them all because obviously, it was not too many: they carried me through until the next time we had to throw out some canned goods, at which point I was able to restock.



Now, it's easy for someone else to say ""X amount of (needed item) is too many.""  But what about when I run out?  At that point, if I have no way to get more of it, it WASN'T too many of that item and I wasn't wrong for wanting to stock up on more.



So how do you folks decide how much is or isn't enough?



And how do you get over the fear of ""If I get rid of this and then later I need it and can't afford to replace it, I'm screwed.""?

Decluttering,"I've been on a decluttering kick for the last 6 months or so but I have really ramped it up in the last week or so. In this time I've also been emotional and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how this might affect me when I'm feeling better.

Anxiety about decluttering and what comes next,"None of the things I'm getting rid of are things I even use. I never used them. I fought with my ex boyfriend to keep them.

Getting rid of these things closes the door on the business that I was in. I'm giving a car load to my friend this week. But the stuff never should have stepped foot in my house.

My files are mostly tidy, and I'm ready to do my late taxes. Almost. I've been making regular trips to Goodwill and using up the little hotel bottles of shampoo. Snowball technique for the win. How do we get so many little hygiene supplies?

I keep finding all these Corners with clutter in them. A laptop bag full of basically trash because I threw everything out. Why was I carrying that around?

If it's old or broken I'm getting rid of it. Pretty much if it exists I'm getting rid of it. I need to be free from all this stuff. 

I'm getting prepared to move even though I don't have any plans to do so.

Stuck at decluttering unused storage solutions.,"I've come a long way from the past 15 years or so. From a messy teenager with a huge bedroom bursting at the seams, to a thirty year old living in a minimalist studio apartment. 

I don't have a lot of storage in my place and I love it that way. Less place for clutter to hide. I did a big purge during my vacation, and got rid of a lot of things I didn't needed. I even surprised myself with how much stuff I removed from my place. 

Except that now, I have a whole lot of nice storage solutions that I can't seem to let go off. There's a huge stack of small to medium sizes bins, boxes, trays, baskets, etc. that I just can't let go. I keep reshuffling things around, thinking such or such box or basket is better suited, only to change my mind two days after and switch things again. Rinse. Repeat.  X 10. 

It's a mess. Some of them have a sentimental value but absolutely clash with my decor, some of them I love the colour and shape but they are awkward to use or too small/big, others I don't particularly love but are more cohesive with my other storage solutions. There's the ones who fit perfectly in one particular spot that just make absolute sense but are downright ugly. There's those I want to love because I paid a pretty penny for, those I want to keep because they were such a bargain...etc. 

I'm a storage solution hoarder. 

I'd like to just get rid of them all, but I can't. I don't have the cash to replace them all and anyway, I don't even know by what I would replace them. Obviously the ideal would be to not need storage solutions in the first place, but since I don't have much storage already, some things just need to have a place. 

Some days I want to display some stuff I have in boxes, other days I want them hidden in boxes... I just can't seem to make up my mind so I can't get rid of them because I'm afraid I'll regret it.

"Trying to declutter whole house, running into difficulties.","First off, I'm gonna say, I do not care to try Marie Kondo's method. I've read her book and tried it and it just wasn't for me. While I recognize that she does have some good tips for letting things go, again, her methods just aren't for me. 

That being said, I am trying to declutter my whole house.  We aren't hoarder status bad, but we have closets and dressers that are overflowing, and our garage is full of stuff (out garage door broke down so we stopped using it and just always used it as storage). 

I will say that due to depression/anxiety, I haven't been able to clean as well as I would like, or as often, but a large part of it was due to the stress my job was causing me. But, I work for a school and have had the summer off, so I started cleaning here and there, and for the last two weeks made sure to spend at least half an hour sorting through things and getting rid of at few things a day. 

But it feels like it's not getting any closer to being done. Like no matter how many garbage bags I take out of stuff, it doesn't even look like any progress has been made. I've cleared tops of dressers and bookshelves, so that all looks better, but a lot of the stuff, I just moved elsewhere, so it's just being shifted around. 

There is a lot of stuff I truly do want/need to keep, but storing everything feels impossible. I was thinking of renting out a storage unit just for a month or two, and put in all of the things I know 100% sure I'm keeping but won't need for a month or so (seasonal clothing, etc) and then that way I can have more room to sort out the crap I don't want and can toss things out more easily and then bring back what I'm keeping once I have room. And of course, in the meantime, other than food, I do not plan on buying anything to add to it all. 

Has anyone used a storage room for this purpose? If so did it actually help or was it just easy to have another space to just hide things away? I know people just have storage units indefinitely, but I don't want to spend a ton of money per month on that...but then again, the luxury of having extra space and a nicer looking home could be worth it. 

I do think that hitting the flea market might be a good idea to make some money and get rid of some stuff, as there is box of stuff that I have been trying to sell on ebay, and while some things are actually selling, my stuff not moving as quickly as I would like so a flea market, while having to lower prices considerably, could hopefully help me get rid of a bunch of stuff quicker. 

Anyone else have any tips or ideas as to what I can do so I can see some progress? I am quitting my miserable job soon, so if I don't have a job by the time I quit, then I'll have a lot of free time to have at it. Even with a new job, I would hope it wouldn't be as bad for my mental wellbeing and therefore I might not be as tired/depressed/stressed to clean up...(and no I'm not going to secure another job before quitting, I am far too miserable to do that...plus I have been looking for new jobs for a year now, and I am not willing to allow myself to get stuck in it another year).

Better Ways To Store Binders Than Bookshelf?,"I have been on a big paper cleanup since the end of the semester. I have a lot of individual documents, personal manuscripts, and other materials that I use infrequently contained in a small filing cabinet.

An ugly bird dish is not the physical manifestation of your memory.,"Clutter and inheriting things I do not want gives me pretty serious anxiety. I’m getting married in September and my grandmother repeatedly has been trying to give me her possessions - namely dishwater. She has a collection with literally hundreds of items in it. She grew up in the depression so apparently owning lots of things indicates you’ve made it in life or something. /eyeroll/ I’m not even joking when I say she makes up conflict about who said they want which items in her house. 

I guess she wasn’t happy with me saying “thanks but no thanks” to her trying to gift large portions of this collection off on on me. This weekend my fiancé and I are having a wedding shower, and my mother told me my grandma intends on giving me a super important plate. I have never seen this plate. I have never heard of this plate. She has never mentioned this plate. My mom sent me a picture. It’s so ugly. It has this weird lace type ceramic design around the edge that doesn’t match the color on the solid parts of the plate. It has two bird painted on it. Why couldn’t she pick out something from the registry that has items (including dishware) we will use! Every day! In all price ranges!

"Method: Reclaiming living room from ""acute clutter"" of crafts project","I recently completed a costume for an event. I made it in about 2 weeks, which meant that it made my living room, living room and kitchen floors, and kitchen table into an absolute war zone of mess. Here's the steps I took to reclaim the space: 

1) **Set expectations about what's worth saving**. I recognize that I have hoarder genes, and I recognize that technically I *could* use all those itty bitty scraps of felt and cardboard for ""something"" someday... But my time is literally worth money now that I have a job. For this cleanup, I drew the line that I'm willing to waste all scraps of stuff smaller than my hand -- if I need a piece of material so tiny later, it's OK to cut up a bigger piece. This step is key, because trying to save literally every potentially-usable little dime-sized scrap is frugal with material but unforgivably wasteful with time. 

2) **Decide where the stuff I'm keeping will go**. In my case, that's the tote box that I pulled my materials out of to begin with for all consumable sewing stuff. Thread and ribbons will go on the wall rack I have for them; tools like scissors will go back in their places; stuff from the kitchen (knives, dishes, etc) will all go into the sink where I can wash it later; needles and pins and stuff will all go in a big ceramic dish from which I can sort them out later. 

2.5) **Look at the mess**. Check the mental list of stuff I want to keep against the actual mess, to make sure I haven't missed anything. If anything stands out as worth keeping but doesn't have a planned home, I repeat steps 1 and 2 until my plan matches reality.

3) **Put away the big, easy stuff**. This means folding up the large pieces of fabric, putting away intact balls of yarn, dumping beads from dishes into plastic baggies (you could use glass jars if you're all /r/zerowaste), etc. This serves 2 purposes: First, it makes me feel like I'm making progress at a good rate, and second, it reveals all the stuff that was underneath these items. 

4) **Do a sweep of each surface to sort keepable stuff from garbage**. To do this, first grab a garbage bag. Pick a surface and scoot the mess on it so there's a small open area available. Pick out some items from the mess that you're obviously going to keep -- tools, containers, etc -- and put them in the cleaned spot. Shove the remaining mess a bit more, so the spot of clean table and keepable things expands. Pick out some items that are obviously garbage; put them in the trash bag. Scoot stuff so the mess is a bit smaller and the stuff-to-keep space is a bit bigger; repeat until you're down to a pile of tiny bits of garbage and sweep it into the bag or even onto the floor. 

4.5) **Visually check the surfaces** to make sure nothing that's actually recycling snuck through. I step back and catch the hoarder habits like ""of course I can use this crumpled piece of paper to draw on!"" or ""I might need those tiny scraps of metal!"" and relocate any fake-keeper items to the recycling. I reassure my hoarder-brain that if I need those things before recycling day, I can always pull them back out of the recycling container.

5) Once all the surfaces have only stuff-to-keep on them, **sort the stuff on the floors**. I like to imagine a laser beam line slowly moving across the floor as I tidy, delineating the growing space I've done from the shrinking space I have yet to do. On the floors, when I find an item worth keeping, I dust it off and set it on the nearest surface. I pick up all the garbage too big for the vacuum cleaner to handle, and leave the little stuff. 

6) **Put away the stuff on the surfaces**. I know I only put stuff there if it's to be kept, so the challenge is just relocating items to where they belong. Since I decided the target locations for everything I'm keeping earlier, this is a pretty brainless task that just requires walking around a lot. 

7) **Put away any containers of stuff to keep** in their designated places, because they were sitting in the middle of the floor previously.

8) **Vacuum the floors** and wipe down the surfaces so everything looks spiffy!

6) **Put away the stuff on the surfaces**. I know I only put stuff there if it's to be kept, so the challenge is just relocating items to where they belong. Since I decided the target locations for everything I'm keeping earlier, this is a pretty brainless task that just requires walking around a lot. 

7) **Put away any containers of stuff to keep** in their designated places, because they were sitting in the middle of the floor previously.

8) **Vacuum the floors** and wipe down the surfaces so everything looks spiffy!

A silver lining to flooding my bathroom,"So I accidentally flooded my bathroom drawers &amp; under the sink (walked away from portable washing machine on bathroom counter while filling it).

How do you downsize way too many family gifts/keepsakes?,"My husband's family has this really bad habit of giving us wayyy more stuff than we want or need. Holidays are actually stressful because of the quantity (which isn't always quality and is often things we don't need or already have).

Tips for a Clutter-Free Counter,"I've always admired people with a beautiful kitchen where everything in it's place and it all looks so darn clean.  Here are some quick, practical tips I have adopted to keep my counters looking spiffy!

1.  Counter space is like ocean-front property, it's extremely valuable and should only be occupied by gadgets that are truly worthy.  Ask yourself how often you actually use each item occupying your counter.  Is the amount of use worth the space it consumes?  Consider the size of an item's footprint before purchase.  Opt for products that meet your needs in as little space as possible.
2. Clean up as you go!  Resist the urge to leave things on the counter.  After you prepare that delicious sandwich, take a moment (before you eat) to return everything to it's home and toss any trash.  Give the counters a super quick wipe down and job done!  You'll be amazed at the difference this makes for such a small time investment.
3. Get creative and create storage!  I recently purchased command books to hang my pot holders on the inside of my cabinet doors.  The slide out shelving units work wonders for lower cabinets.  If pantry space is limited, I highly recommend buying identical plastic storage bins for all your dry goods (pasta, cereal, etc.) and put them on a slide out shelving unit in a lower cabinet.
4. Consider a junk drawer.  I know this flies in the face of conventional wisdom!  I established a junk drawer because my husband is notorious for leaving tools, parts, etc. throughout the house.  Rather than put up with his gripes about things never being where he puts them, he knows to check the junk drawer.  if you go this route, try to declutter the drawer at least once a week and put everything where it belongs.
5. Reassess how your decluttering systems are working on a regular basis and don't be afraid to make changes!

10 Things Often Forgotten When Cleaning,"I don't consider myself a clean freak, but I try to keep a clean home...or at least I thought I did until I started researching how to clean a particular item and realized I forget or do a poor job of cleaning a great deal of things!  This coming from someone who scrubs the counters with cleaner and then goes back and uses anti-bacterial wipes just to be sure).

I got a list of 10 things together and made a quiz out of it for fun...let's just say...I didn't do so hot.

If you asked me if I cleaned some of these things, I would have told you yes, but when I did the research on how they are supposed to be cared for, I realized I fell WAY short.  Then there were the ones I never even considered cleaning.

For example, taking the knobs off of my stove and thoroughly cleaning them and the area they were in.  Let's just say...when I did that, it was not a pretty site under there.  I never even considered the knobs would actually come off.  I just cleaned the tops the outer areas regularly and called it a day.

Anyway, come take the quiz and post on my discussion how you did.  I have no shame, I'll admit that I only got a 3 out of 10.

Okay, maybe I do have a little shame and secretly hope I'm not the only one!  I do clean my house, really I do!  I promise!

Organising miscellaneous 'stuff',"I'm usually pretty good at downsizing and decluttering, but with a young family it gets tough. Things start to accumulate, and it's so easy just to put things in drawers and storage baskets and forget about them. Recently I was forced to confront how much we own, as we are moving house on short notice. 

Packing started easily. Books, clothes, media, toys, collectibles. Simple, wrap, stack and pack. But now we are just a few days from moving and there is a lot of miscellany left. Junk drawers, tools, kitchen items, stationary. Bits and pieces. The stuff you forget about. I've been finding it really difficult to categorise, declutter and pack these items as they've often travelled to different places in the house, or they don't have a set place to be.

One of the things I found really useful when it comes to 'miscellany' was to think, ""if this was in a department store, where would it be?"". Then boxing or bagging them accordingly. 

Pens, rubber bands, Sellotape? Stationary. 
Screwdrivers, Allen keys, nut and bolts? Tools. 
Glasses cases, lip balms, combs? Health and beauty. 

It's made the process much easier, and it may sound silly or maybe this is obvious stuff and I'm just discovering it, but I thought it could help those who have a lot of 'misc' items and need to organise them better.

How to declutter... When most of it isn't mine?! Dealing with sensitive mother,"Hi everyone,

I'm a grad student gearing up to move into my first unfurnished apartment next month (the one I've been living in is furnished). What a big step for me! 

I'm currently staying with my mom for the summer, and she's encouraged me to look around at what furniture she has that I may like to take with me.

While doing that, I've also been going through all my stuff and trying to get rid of things I never use, like useless childhood things I cling onto, clothes I haven't worn since my skinny high school days, etc. I've been taking pictures to ""document them"" for sentimental value, following advice I read somewhere. 

However... My mother has a control problem and wants me to ""run everything by her"" first. And when I do, it's always ""oh, you had that when you were a baby; you can't throw that out"" or ""oh, give to me, maybe I can use it"" (even though she never will).

I do not think she is a hoarder. She always gets mad when people bring her useless stuff, and she generally likes things to be tidy and clean. I think she's just depressed at the moment (well, for a while now) and doesn't care to clean, which I totally understand and am sympathetic to. However, we are living in extreme clutter (one den is completely filled with stuff she took home from a relative's estate, and other random things that appeared there), and I just can't even with this place. She complains about it all the time, but when I stand there with a trash bag and say ""throw away everything you haven't used or thought about in a year!"", she yells at me and makes me feel like I'M doing the bad thing when I'm actually trying to declutter!

So, long story shirt, tl;dy, I'm a grad student finally moving into a place completely filled with my own stuff, and while I live a minimalistic life, my mother is burdened with clutter and I hate being in our house. What are some tips or strategies or other related threads I could look at to help her declutter and not have the big one while I do so?

I'm a grad student gearing up to move into my first unfurnished apartment next month (the one I've been living in is furnished). What a big step for me! 

I'm currently staying with my mom for the summer, and she's encouraged me to look around at what furniture she has that I may like to take with me.

While doing that, I've also been going through all my stuff and trying to get rid of things I never use, like useless childhood things I cling onto, clothes I haven't worn since my skinny high school days, etc. I've been taking pictures to ""document them"" for sentimental value, following advice I read somewhere. 

However... My mother has a control problem and wants me to ""run everything by her"" first. And when I do, it's always ""oh, you had that when you were a baby; you can't throw that out"" or ""oh, give to me, maybe I can use it"" (even though she never will).

I do not think she is a hoarder. She always gets mad when people bring her useless stuff, and she generally likes things to be tidy and clean. I think she's just depressed at the moment (well, for a while now) and doesn't care to clean, which I totally understand and am sympathetic to. However, we are living in extreme clutter (one den is completely filled with stuff she took home from a relative's estate, and other random things that appeared there), and I just can't even with this place. She complains about it all the time, but when I stand there with a trash bag and say ""throw away everything you haven't used or thought about in a year!"", she yells at me and makes me feel like I'M doing the bad thing when I'm actually trying to declutter!

So, long story shirt, tl;dy, I'm a grad student finally moving into a place completely filled with my own stuff, and while I live a minimalistic life, my mother is burdened with clutter and I hate being in our house. What are some tips or strategies or other related threads I could look at to help her declutter and not have the big one while I do so?

How much time should I spend per day decluttering?,I want to start getting up early and devoting a little time before work to decluttering.

How to let go of sentimental (still functional) items?,"I have a hard time letting go of things because 'what if I need it later?' and 'I paid money for this, so I should use it all up' sorts of logic. I didn't grow up with a ton of things, so I've always clung to what I've had because it's been enough. I've always been a paper hoarder (school papers, bills, artwork, etc) and fabric (buying in sales, saving scraps, planning for future project that I may never get to making). I want to get better at being able to let things go, especially when it comes to home clutter. 

I've been trying to go through my closet, which has been through several updates through fashion, but I've never really cleaned it out between every jump. I have a lot of old t-shirts that still fit, that still function as a t-shirt, and have some sort of sentimentality (old high school team, junior high art group, event where I met a really good friend, etc.), and also will probably have no value to anyone else. I feel like it's not worth donating because this wouldn't make anyone else happy, but also don't want to keep holding onto it all, as it takes up space in my small closet. Just throwing it away hurts my heart. I also have pairs of jeans that are just a little worn out that maybe I could fit back into if I lost weight and patched it. I read from advice articles that if it doesn't fit, I should just let it go, and probably buy new clothing when I lose the weight, but how can I deal with letting go of something that I already have now? No resource really talks about how to get over this mental barrier of sentiment in a way I can accept and apply. I also have shirts that I've purchased that I fell out of love with relatively quickly, but kept with the thought that ""maybe I'll love it more in a month or two, or if I bought more pieces that I can wear with it.""

How can I convince myself to let it go and clear out my closet to make breathing room for pieces that I love more and wear more often? I really want to have a lighter closet, but I just get stuck every time when I pull out the old items.

What about other items that don't have a good place to donate, or aren't worth donating? I have a box I sorted of toiletries from hotel stays and soaps that I've never used, a couple of eye shadow pallets, makeup, and hair accessories. I don't use it, but it's all good stuff, so I can't imagine just throwing it all away. At the same time, I really just don't use any of it, and it's taking up space in my bathroom, and I don't know of any resources to donate it to.

I'm trying to cope with the 'sunk cost' fallacy as well. I remember a lot of the prices of everything that I've purchased, and it just stings as I think about donating or throwing it away for nothing back. I think I can list items that I know are valuable on secondhand markets, package them up, and sell/mail away, but the thought that something now has zero value just rubs me the wrong way. When ever I get started trying to list items, I always suddenly feel low-energy and disinterested in the job I've laid out for myself. I'm aware that I'm avoiding it; how do I stop myself and keep active on it?

Is there anyone else that's managed to start from a (low-key) hoarding problem and can share how they let go of the sentimental items and dealt sunk cost fallacy?

Feeling free: happy account of a reformed hoarder,"Hello lovely people! Just felt like sharing my happy declutter story :) 

Grew up as somewhat a hoarder, I always saved all school assignments, notes, letters, rubbish that \*could\* be used for crafting (never used any of it), and so many items that I pictured myself needing when I sometime in the future would get a big enough living space. 

I love travelling and being able to go away for longer periods, which means I've moved many times in the recent years. Each time I've had to repack, log around and unpack all my stuff (except all the other stuff I'd have stashed in my childhood home etc, completely forgetting ofc). Then, two years ago, I bought Marie Kondo's book on a whim during exam period (as one does.. procrastination long live), and decided to to a proper declutter. 

I think the hardest part was books, but I cheated a bit kept all my favorites, and tbh I don't regret that. My biggest surprise though, is how there's nothing I regret getting rid off. All the clothes, supplies, letters etc that I thought I'd miss, haven't thought about any of it. It was *such* a liberating feeling to actually throw things out, and to realise how the things we own actually can just weight us down. 

I've then gone through more of my stuff that has been stashed away at different locations since, to the point where I can now fit everything I own in the storage booth I own, which makes me feel so light and free to go and do wherever. The most recent thing I went through and got rid of a large portion of was yarn. For years, I've been hoarding yarn thinking ""I love yarn and knitting so having a lot of it must make me happier, right?"". Turns out, it has just given me constant bad conscience, and when I really want to make something, I've just felt bad because I already had so many projects in the making. Well, now I am free to do whatever, and I kept only the yarn I *really* love or want and I have it all on display. The rest I gave to a local school and they were super happy. Win-win!

(Another huge plus is how easy it is to tidy my place now, it used to always be super messy when I had so many things I didn't love or need)

I guess many of you have similar stories to mine! I don't think I ever could go back to a hoarding lifestyle now, and I find this community and mentality so inspiring.

"My technique to help combat the ""but I might need it one day"" barrier to decluttering","As with a lot of people, I have trouble getting rid of functional items that I haven't used in ages, because I worry that I may need the item someday. For the longest time this has kept me from being able to really go through my possessions and trim down how much stuff I have.

Recently I realized a technique that allowed me to get over this psychological hurdle. I look up how much the item can be purchased for today. Probably 99% of the time, I am surprised at how cheap it would be to just buy the item down the road new. This takes away all of my guilt for getting rid of the item, as I now know that I can always buy a replacement if I truly need the item later.

Sick of my furniture / moving,"Moving in two weeks, downsizing from 3500 sf to 2300 sf (same town).

My 40 bag challenge,"I bought a 40 pack of huge heavy duty contractor bags and I’m giving myself a challenge - get rid of 40 contractor bags’ worth of stuff in 20 weeks. 

My rules I made up:  my garbage allows 2 bulk items (such as contractors bags) out every week so if I have garbage stuff I can throw 2 bags out a week. Realistically the two bags will be stuff that is donated but I do know there is some stuff not even worth donating.

If I have items to sell if I don’t list it on eBay or craigslist by the time the next week rolls around (my garbage day is Friday) then it has to be donated so I can avoid the “oh I’m going to sell this!” mentality that I have where I intend to sell things and then never get around to it. 

I realize 20 weeks is a long time and contractor bags are HUGE but I have a whole attic to clean out as well as clutter around the living space that I want to deal with. I work full time and have a toddler and a baby so this really will be a big challenge for me to find the time to do it but I just can’t take it anymore and my husband is on board with me getting rid of whatever I want to do there’s not much standing in my way other than time management and consistency!

I’ll check back in a month or so to update and let you know how things are going and if this challenge was a good idea or not! Or if anyone has any input on “rules” then I want to hear if.

Help! Inability to identify excess belongings,"A bit of background: I am 26 years old and grew up with a mother who couldn't get rid of anything. Even when I tried to purge my own belongings I would find them stored in the garage ""Just in case I changed my mind"".

Need help with letting go of books / declutter anxiety,"My entire summer break I have been aiming to donate/sell a lot of my belongings and I have made it nowhere. To preface this I have a lot of anxiety about money and wasting it and it stops me from getting rid of stuff.

One of my main objectives is clearing out my bookshelf. I use to buy A LOT of books when I was younger and now I feel like it was such a waste. Some of the books I haven't even read or I lost interest in and stopped reading which I feel terrible about since that's definitely a waste of money. 

I lost a lot of interest in reading along the way and I hoped that I would get back into it, but I don't know if I really will. I don't know if it's due to depression, or school, or whatever else but I find it really hard to read anything now. My mom even got me a set of books for my birthday a few years back and I only made it partway through the first book before stopping. I also asked for some artbooks for Christmas a few years ago which seem so superfluous now. I even bought a few thrifted books earlier this summer to hopefully try to get myself back into reading just for them to sit there unread like everything else. I think that it's time to give it up. I simultaneously hate looking at all of the books on my shelves since I feel guilty for having them and not using them, yet I can't bring myself to part with them. I wish that I just got a library card so I didn't have so many books lying around now.

I'd like to start by at least selling what I can of my childhood books, but I find it hard to let them go. I even made it as far as marking my name out of some to prepare them to be sold just to completely change course the next day and thinking ""What am I doing? These were so special to me when I was younger and I would lose so much money even if I sold them, maybe I should just keep them"". I know that in reality I haven't touched them in years, but these thoughts still nag at me. It makes me sad to think about letting them go, but at the same time they are just sitting on a shelf anyway. I don't know how to describe it accurately, but it's like I feel some level of guilt for letting them go. I feel especially bad if it was something that was gifted to me.

How to replace things when I can't afford to,"Please don't judge me for my lifestyle. It's something I regret as I feel like I've worked myself into a stalemate so I'm currently figuring how to solve this. (Please excuse my verbosity as well)

I don't really have a lot of stuff compared to others because 

1. I've moved houses 20+ times (3 cities/towns) so I'm no stranger to decluttering, no longer have stuff from my childhood save the ones my parents managed to keep (and most of these are shared between siblings) And due to the constant moving (sometimes an overnight move) I've learned to keep a go bag and not accumulate stuff 

2. I've been unemployed for close to ten years (except a few months in between when I was involved in some web design project that fell through), living a somewhat parasitic lifestyle (I live with family). 

In the beginning of the unemployment I struggled with depression and was a complete mess (also had a major breakup). I held onto stuff like old out of trend clothes because I just couldn't afford to replace them. After the birth of my child five years ago I did a major declutter - donate, dispose, sell... mostly stuff from when I co-habit with an ex (not the child's father), in which the breakup sent me spiraling into deep depression. Once I got rid of almost everything that reminded me of the life I shared with him, I rarely thought of him anymore!!! I instantly felt lighter, slept better, started looking better, felt less bad about myself. There's however a few things that I kept out of necessity/can't afford to replace, and sure enough it's almost like it still reminds me of that life in the back of my head every time I looked at/used it. 

Although I was determined to change and rebuild my life after that major decluttering, I made bad calls and again, started accumulating stuff gifted/bought by subsequent lovers (nothing fancy like diamonds etc - I'm not that hot!). I could take a look around me and about 90&amp;#37; of my belongings is not bought by my own hard-earned cash. 

* PC monitor - given to me by my dad when he bought himself a new one - it's falling apart, the screen is riddled with white specks and I see streaks (probably from overheating), not to mention the two yellow/green permanent vertical lines caused by damage because it fell off during a fight with an ex
* Smartphone, a fitness smartwatch and external HDD (that I use daily) gifted by the last 'boyfriend' (of three weeks, two years ago, I've been single since, not emotionally attached to this dating relationship because we were each other's rebound). I didn't really ask for these, he gifted me the watch on our first date (we met online), turns out my old phone couldn't download the app, so he bought me a new smartphone so that I could use the watch, and then later the HDD because 'it was a great deal'. I probably would have got rid of these once we broke up, or should I say, I wouldn't even needed these had I been able to afford them myself? because you know, don't keep things related to a past relationship 
* Sex toy and a 2011 sony nex camera - Now these. That same 3 weeks bf gifted me the sex toy that he meant for an ex but they broke up before he could. (I know, I know.) This is some really expensive gadget so I kept it. (No, I don't use it, come to think of it, I wouldn't feel sorry if I chucked it in the bin RIGHT NOW) The camera was an online shopping mix up - he purchased one he was sent two. Guess who the other one was for? The same ex (that I was the rebound for). I asked for this camera because I needed it and he wasn't using it. I could probably fetch some money if I sold this but it won't be enough for me to buy a new one.  So the camera is on my ""I will replace it with a new one I bought with my legit income"" list along with the HDD, smartphone, smartwatch. 
* oven and most baking tools - bought partially by another ex-lover, I started baking when I 'dated' this guy because I had wanted to open a home baking business. This is also on the ""I will replace it with a new one I bought with my legit income"" list.
* Clothes (bagged - 1) - I still have office attire from ten years ago, when I was a new intern fresh out of college. I've rid most of my casual pretty clothes from then, but I held onto these. I meant to sell them five years ago but I procrastinated and five years went by since. My excuse? These are 'good quality' clothes, that I bought, with my own salary from then. But I think subconsciously I held onto them because those were the glorious days when I was employed, part of the productive member of the society, and I could hold my head high, worked 8-5 weekdays and shopped at malls weekend, like most of the 'normal' people (at least where I live). 
* Clothes (bagged - 2) clothes when I first met and worked with my child's birth father (who turned out to be a piece of sh\*t) I could look at some of these and instantly be transported back to moments shared with him (which I clearly detest). I seem to remember clothes I've worn on dates better than some of the faces of my dates, SMH.  
* Clothes (wardrobe - actually I can fit all of my wearable clothes into a carry on, eg, I have only a pair of jeans) - Not a single piece bought with my own cash. Most of these clothes/shoes were bought by ex-lover 3 years ago and the 'bf' two years ago. So they're quite dated, but I'm still wearing them. These are the basic clothes I would have donate/sold/dispose without any hesitation (no sentimental ties whatsoever) but then I don't have any income to replace them. Should have sold them right after our breakup. My mistake. 
* Books. I have only about 10+ paperbacks - favorites. These I'm keeping, as I've already pared them down over the years. My trouble is with my child's books (about 20+, mostly board books). Some of these are paid for by ex-lover (oven/clothes guy). Ideally I would sell/donate these and then repurchase them with my own money, but child has grown attached to them. To be fair, I haven't bought one book for her since last year (and that one was a bargain!). We've started frequenting the library last year and has thus far read over 500 books. 
* Toys - we don't have a lot actually. If I laid the toys on the floor, it would take up about 4 square feet? My problem is that most of these are bought by ex-lover/bf, and some of these are old toys my mom dug up (not even donation worthy), which I hate seeing... but again, my child has grown attached to them (especially the plushies)! I could bargain with child - one new toy to replace an old one, but I proposed the idea and were asked ""why can't I keep both old and new?"" Seeing as again, can't afford to buy new ones now, I'll have to bear with this, and most probably until child outgrows them.
* Paper clutters - I've pared these down over the years and try to type up notes instead of writing. But I still got a stack I haven't gotten to. 
* Homeschool items - Workbooks, printed worksheets (new and done), art and craft materials. Not a lot but I'll keep these until my child attends formal school in two years.

",declutter,1531208469,buzzbuzzwakeup,5,6,True,8xmpec,2018-07-10,"How to replace things when I can't afford to Please don't judge me for my lifestyle. It's something I regret as I feel like I've worked myself into a stalemate so I'm currently figuring how to solve this. (Please excuse my verbosity as well)

I don't really have a lot of stuff compared to others because 

1. I've moved houses 20+ times (3 cities/towns) so I'm no stranger to decluttering, no longer have stuff from my childhood save the ones my parents managed to keep (and most of these are shared between siblings) And due to the constant moving (sometimes an overnight move) I've learned to keep a go bag and not accumulate stuff 

2. I've been unemployed for close to ten years (except a few months in between when I was involved in some web design project that fell through), living a somewhat parasitic lifestyle (I live with family). 

In the beginning of the unemployment I struggled with depression and was a complete mess (also had a major breakup). I held onto stuff like old out of trend clothes because I just couldn't afford to replace them. After the birth of my child five years ago I did a major declutter - donate, dispose, sell... mostly stuff from when I co-habit with an ex (not the child's father), in which the breakup sent me spiraling into deep depression. Once I got rid of almost everything that reminded me of the life I shared with him, I rarely thought of him anymore!!! I instantly felt lighter, slept better, started looking better, felt less bad about myself. There's however a few things that I kept out of necessity/can't afford to replace, and sure enough it's almost like it still reminds me of that life in the back of my head every time I looked at/used it. 

Although I was determined to change and rebuild my life after that major decluttering, I made bad calls and again, started accumulating stuff gifted/bought by subsequent lovers (nothing fancy like diamonds etc - I'm not that hot!). I could take a look around me and about 90&amp;#37; of my belongings is not bought by my own hard-earned cash. 

* PC monitor - given to me by my dad when he bought himself a new one - it's falling apart, the screen is riddled with white specks and I see streaks (probably from overheating), not to mention the two yellow/green permanent vertical lines caused by damage because it fell off during a fight with an ex
* Smartphone, a fitness smartwatch and external HDD (that I use daily) gifted by the last 'boyfriend' (of three weeks, two years ago, I've been single since, not emotionally attached to this dating relationship because we were each other's rebound). I didn't really ask for these, he gifted me the watch on our first date (we met online), turns out my old phone couldn't download the app, so he bought me a new smartphone so that I could use the watch, and then later the HDD because 'it was a great deal'. I probably would have got rid of these once we broke up, or should I say, I wouldn't even needed these had I been able to afford them myself? because you know, don't keep things related to a past relationship 
* Sex toy and a 2011 sony nex camera - Now these. That same 3 weeks bf gifted me the sex toy that he meant for an ex but they broke up before he could. (I know, I know.) This is some really expensive gadget so I kept it. (No, I don't use it, come to think of it, I wouldn't feel sorry if I chucked it in the bin RIGHT NOW) The camera was an online shopping mix up - he purchased one he was sent two. Guess who the other one was for? The same ex (that I was the rebound for). I asked for this camera because I needed it and he wasn't using it. I could probably fetch some money if I sold this but it won't be enough for me to buy a new one.  So the camera is on my ""I will replace it with a new one I bought with my legit income"" list along with the HDD, smartphone, smartwatch. 
* oven and most baking tools - bought partially by another ex-lover, I started baking when I 'dated' this guy because I had wanted to open a home baking business. This is also on the ""I will replace it with a new one I bought with my legit income"" list.
* Clothes (bagged - 1) - I still have office attire from ten years ago, when I was a new intern fresh out of college. I've rid most of my casual pretty clothes from then, but I held onto these. I meant to sell them five years ago but I procrastinated and five years went by since. My excuse? These are 'good quality' clothes, that I bought, with my own salary from then. But I think subconsciously I held onto them because those were the glorious days when I was employed, part of the productive member of the society, and I could hold my head high, worked 8-5 weekdays and shopped at malls weekend, like most of the 'normal' people (at least where I live). 
* Clothes (bagged - 2) clothes when I first met and worked with my child's birth father (who turned out to be a piece of sh\*t) I could look at some of these and instantly be transported back to moments shared with him (which I clearly detest). I seem to remember clothes I've worn on dates better than some of the faces of my dates, SMH.  
* Clothes (wardrobe - actually I can fit all of my wearable clothes into a carry on, eg, I have only a pair of jeans) - Not a single piece bought with my own cash. Most of these clothes/shoes were bought by ex-lover 3 years ago and the 'bf' two years ago. So they're quite dated, but I'm still wearing them. These are the basic clothes I would have donate/sold/dispose without any hesitation (no sentimental ties whatsoever) but then I don't have any income to replace them. Should have sold them right after our breakup. My mistake. 
* Books. I have only about 10+ paperbacks - favorites. These I'm keeping, as I've already pared them down over the years. My trouble is with my child's books (about 20+, mostly board books). Some of these are paid for by ex-lover (oven/clothes guy). Ideally I would sell/donate these and then repurchase them with my own money, but child has grown attached to them. To be fair, I haven't bought one book for her since last year (and that one was a bargain!). We've started frequenting the library last year and has thus far read over 500 books. 
* Toys - we don't have a lot actually. If I laid the toys on the floor, it would take up about 4 square feet? My problem is that most of these are bought by ex-lover/bf, and some of these are old toys my mom dug up (not even donation worthy), which I hate seeing... but again, my child has grown attached to them (especially the plushies)! I could bargain with child - one new toy to replace an old one, but I proposed the idea and were asked ""why can't I keep both old and new?"" Seeing as again, can't afford to buy new ones now, I'll have to bear with this, and most probably until child outgrows them.
* Paper clutters - I've pared these down over the years and try to type up notes instead of writing. But I still got a stack I haven't gotten to. 
* Homeschool items - Workbooks, printed worksheets (new and done), art and craft materials. Not a lot but I'll keep these until my child attends formal school in two years. I think a major reorganizing needs to be done. I have problem with keeping the craft items - in that I have no space to display, but risk squashing if I store them. 
* Laptop - Bought this four years ago, partly with a deposit paid by a web design client (project fell through, partly my fault), partly by my parents who wanted to help me regain my footing after becoming a single mom. Every time I use it, I'm reminded of the failed project, guilty etc. Recently one of the keys stopped working.

For example, I have a pile of board games that I spent good money on but haven't played in years. They do not really have any resale value that is worth listing on eBay, and no private party buyers interested locally.

The actual process of decluttering is making me miserable,"So I’m in a situation right now where I’ve recently graduated from college, and I am moving out of my parents’ house (and moving halfway across the country) in just about a month. I’m basically only bringing with me whatever I can fit in the car. I will be able to store some stuff that I’ll need in the future (like furniture) at my parents’ house, because it’s a only a one-year placement that I’m moving for. 

Like a lot of college students, I’ve been back and forth living at school and at home for the last four years. I’ve got a lot of stuff to try and go through and get rid of now. I wasn’t feeling like I was “drowning in my clutter” before, but I obviously cannot bring very much with me, and my parents don’t want to be keeping huge amounts of my things in the basement. I also don’t want to be trying to deal with it if/when when I do move back to the area next year.

I understand the practical need to declutter, but the actual process is making me feel totally miserable. It’s not “liberating” or “life-altering.” It just makes me feel horrible. I have a sentimental attachment to a lot of my things, maybe more than some other people do, because I grew up as a military brat. I don’t have a childhood home, or even really a hometown, but I do have these things that I’ve been holding onto all through middle and high school and now college. Wherever we moved (and it was all over the place, and frequently), what gave me stability and comfort was opening my boxes and unpacking my things in my room. Even though I’m an adult now and I don’t really need that security anymore, it’s still very painful to get rid of even simple stuff, like old sneakers or school notebooks. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve been working on reducing my footprint for a few weeks now and it’s been a very slow and not super efficient process. It makes me really anxious and it keeps me up at night sometimes. Sorry if this seems negative; I’m not usually a negative person but this has been absorbing my energy and just making me feel like crap...

Decluttering my classroom,"I decluttered the majority of stuff from my classroom today. I've had to move classes every year I've been at this school (3 times) but each time has been a chance to get rid of some stuff.

This time was huge because I was moving out of a classroom that, 2 teachers ago, had been occupied by a hoarder. The teacher before me says she had gotten rid of half the stuff and I still inherited closets studded with old teaching materials, posters, games, puzzles, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it had been around since before I was born. 

I didn't ever get time to go through it during the busy school year, but today was a PA day for us to clean out and move if needed, or do whatever else we needed in our classrooms. I was honestly impressed that I managed to clear out all of the cupboards I needed given how tired I was, coupled with the heat.

I recycled as much as I could, but most of it ended up going into garbage bags. I think there were 4 large garbage bags and 1 large recycling bag. I feel bad for the environmental impact, but hopefully now that it's gone I won't have to do that on this scale again. I get to move only stuff I actually want to my new classroom, and I feel that I can set up a calm and organized learning environment for my class next year.

I am especially happy because we moved in March -- we had so much STUFF that we filled our car 5 times; a U-Haul truck, AND a U-haul cargo van for 3 people! It was insane. We're in a bigger place but it feels more open because we've gotten rid of so much of the junk!",0
Yard Sales - A Warning,"Back in about November I did a big yard sale, my friend brought some stuff to get rid off to.  We had quite a lot of stuff.  It wasn't as successful as I expected, and some things (books) did not sell AT ALL.  Anyway, afterwards we loaded everything in the car and immediately dropped it off at the charity shop.  Amazing, so much stuff gone!

The warning is here:  Our next door neighbours were obviously inspired by us and a few weeks after us, decided to have a yard sale too.  The usual household detritus.  Now here is the warning:  The didn't take all the rubbish that was left to the charity shop.  Nope, they piled in all in the car port and left it.  AND ITS STILL THERE.  Now it's well over six months later and the stuff must be total trash by now because of the weather.  They could have left it on the verge and people would have picked it up for free.


So BEWARNED you folk with verge sale aspirations and follow these steps so as not to not end up like my neighbours

1.  Price everything $1 or $2 or 5 for $1 etc.

2.  You will not sell as much as you think you will

3.

Interesting conversation with my dad about clutter,"I had to go across the country for a funeral on Friday. I stayed with my dad.

On Saturday morning, we were talking. He mentioned that I would be taking his considerable collection of antiques.

I told him that after he died, I was going to pay a house clearance company to take him away.

""But... my grandfather clock is 220 years old!"" he said. I said that it was bigger than my house, and for that matter it hadn't worked since I was a teenager. I then told him that I loved him, not his stuff, and that the one possession that I was keeping from him was the ceramic basin he made for me at a pottery course that took him three years (the first five attempts broke as he made them). I plugged it up with Milliput, and it's a miniature Japanese garden now. I really love it. 

He smiled. Told me he loved me too. And we talked about something else.",declutter,1530520136,Ichooset,57,228,True,8vh1x9,2018-07-02,"Interesting conversation with my dad about clutter I had to go across the country for a funeral on Friday. I stayed with my dad.

Question about decluttering things in wake of family death,"Hey everyone!

My mom died almost three months ago, and it's been really hard to grieve while also trying to move forward with my life (We were VERY close and I was one of her two main caretakers). For the last few months I've done a really good job decluttering in preparation for the inevitability that my dad will sell the house in a year and I may not be here to help him. I went through her jewelry and scarves and whatever I decided not to keep, I gave them away to friends and family. I gave away all of her clothes too, and then I went through the house and decluttered basically everything...houseware, kitchenware, books,  etc. We're just keeping the things that we'll either sell or keep in the family....my brother and I will be living in small places, and so will my dad. We got rid of a LOT. 

Well now I'm decluttering the last of my personal items and I've come across a few items that remind me of my mom in a not so great way. For example, my mom gave me Urban Decay's Moondust palette last fall for my birthday...this was RIGHT before we learned the cancer had spread and that things were not looking good. So when I look at that palette I feel kind of sad but then when I  played with it a little bit and put the colors on my lids I was like omg this is sooo pretty. 

So I'm torn.  I don't know how to deal with these conflicting feelings and whether keeping something that reminds me of a negative time in my life is holding me back. Should I just store it away for awhile until the grief becomes a little easier to deal with?

Thank you!!",declutter,1530551319,dawishnk,9,16,True,8vkbua,2018-07-02,"Question about decluttering things in wake of family death Hey everyone!

Declutter Everything in One Month?,"My husband and I have been decluttering over the past year in anticipation of buying a home.  We decided to leave the state after much soul searching, and my husband applied to other jobs.  He has been offered employment contingent on a background check in a much higher cost of living area, and they will probably be asking him to start in August.  We went from expecting to have 1500+ square feet of space in a home to 500-650 square feet of space in an apartment.

We will be throwing away and donating all of our old furniture except for a small TV console.  The issue we're running into is that we have lots of boxes.  I have 6 large plastic bins containing books, and that's after selling off another 4 bins last year!  This is what I'm having the most trouble emotionally detaching from as I re-read my books when I have them displayed and accessible on bookcases.  I also have 5 large plastic bins of Halloween decor, and although I can part with these items I would rather sell them given their value.  I also have a lot of high quality cold weather clothing despite soon moving to a year round warm weather location--all stuff that I could sell online but not in the middle of summer.  Then there are odds and ends boxes: Christmas ornaments, beach supplies, lots of boots, childhood comics, wedding memorabilia, family silverware, 1920s family china (2 large boxes!), several large boxes with childhood/family photo albums from both sides of our family.  Plus we have a toddler with all of her clothes and toys that will need to be boxed up.

I would love to take my time and sell books to used bookstores, sell clothes/Halloween things online, and throw away mementos after thinking them over.  But I don't have time.  How is the best way to tackle this?  Do I hand over the bins of book boxes to a used bookstore after taking out my favorite 5-10 books and pray that I forget the majority of what I just sold?  Do I sell my clothes and boots in bulk somewhere or just donate them despite the fact that I could have sold them for a lot individually?  Same for Halloween--do I sell them in bulk to another enthusiastic despite the fact that I could get at least $1000 selling stuff individually?  Do I leave all the family items and mementos behind with another family member?  

The alternative is that I bring all this *stuff* with us and then sell/donate it after we get there, but I anticipate that being a long process of listing items for sale on eBay and forums while I have a huge amount of boxes stacked in my future living room.

How to focus on the little things?,"It’s easy for me to appreciate the big picture- I want to declutter and have less stuff. But it’s hard to decide what to get rid of. I have a lot of clothes but I wear them all and have already gotten rid of the stuff that doesn’t fit or I never wear....but it causes me anxiety to have so many and have to deal with storage and laundry. I have too many books, but I’ve gotten rid of the obvious rejects and the ones that remain are special or really amazing and hard to come by at the library (not great where I live) and I hate e/readers. How do I break past my hang ups on individual items to accomplish my ultimate goal of decluttering? Everything can be useful or save me money by avoiding needing to replace it later. I’m not a crazy hoarder by any means, just a person who doesn’t want a large living space to keep all this stuff in.

New to this sub but I want to continue my small progress,"Hello /r/declutter, I'm happy to have found this place exists :) I'm a 43 year old single dad. I own an upper level condo and have my 11 year old son every other week. Our place has too much stuff so it is basically always messy and cluttered, and it makes me unhappy.

I feel I have enough space for both of us, I just need to declutter. I've been told the secret to keeping things tidy is to have a place for everything, so that any item you own you can pick up and know where it is supposed to go. If you don't, and can't find a space for it, you can't have it and expect to have a tidy house.

I'm an I.T. person with no real hobbies or activities that require me to keep a lot of stuff around.

My main problem stems from being a person who has struggled with both a major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder for many years. It seems I am a person who is very low energy on my own, procrastinates and generally loses drive to improve things by myself.

When I was married, I did better, because I was more motivated to keep things tidy living with someone else, and she was a very neat person and someone who was very good at decluttering, perhaps a little too good, as she would get rid of things that sometimes later became needed.

The past few months I stopped going on Facebook (yes I'm old) because I found I was using it to cover for lack of social life and an easy way to escape work around the house.

My son isn't too helpful, as he doesn't see an issue with clutter and keeps wanting to get ""more stuff"", which I keep resisting.

I just really don't like it, and get embarrassed by the clutter whenever someone comes by.

So, in recent months I've just started going through little bits at a time; a counter here, a pile there, throwing away or recycling obvious junk, and putting the other stuff into boxes.

Now I have a bunch of boxes cluttering the place haha! :P

Anyway, I found this sub and have started reading up on the helpful posts for ideas and seeing other people's experiences with decluttering.

I'm fortunate that I don't need to worry about selling, I'm likely just going to be throwing out, recycling or donating. My big problem is staying motivated, avoiding procrastination, and continuing to make progress.

FINALLY Sorted Through My Clothes,"I've been telling myself for two years that I was going to sort through my clothes and get rid of the stuff I don't wear. I never even started. Things spilled over into other areas. My drawers were full, and the rest of the stuff shoved in bags. I often couldn't find my favorite clothes.

Today, I had to move all the bags to make space for a piece of furniture. So, I said...why not get all my clothes and sort them? 

After everything got sorted, I now am down to:
12 shirts (mostly my favorite band tees and three blank black shirts)
7 pairs of pants (3 shorts, 3 regular pants, 1 pajama pant)
6 bras
1 undershirt
Various undies (I'm not going to count them)

I have a medium size bag with some winter specific clothes in it. Thicker pants, a few long sleeve shirts, my jacket. 

I have a large trashbag packed full of all the stuff I never wear.

What great place did you find for things that needed to be kept?,"When I find a perfect (or maybe just better?) spot for something or things, I get really excited when it works better than whatever I was doing before.  For example, the washcloths were just on a big, deep shelf in a linen closet in the bathroom.   But they were always falling over and just did not fit the space well like the bath towels do.  Cleaning out the sink vanity, I tried them out in a small, deep bottom drawer where they fill the whole space when all laundered.  So they don't fall over and it is easy to see when I need to wash towels.  They just needed a proper home. It also kind of illustrates the amount I should own it the amount that fits in this drawer and no more.

Painted my bedroom,"I've been decluttering and getting rid of excess furniture for two and a half years now. I inherited my grandparents' house, where my mother also lived during her last years. It was filled with heirlooms from multiple great-grandparents, great-aunts and -uncles, family friends, miscellaneous antiques and lots of collectibles, tools, waaaay too much furniture, thousands of antique family photos, paintings, vehicles, and so on.

So I'm getting pretty close to the end. I've given away everything possible to family members who want it, I've sold things, thrown things away, donated things, and every week the house looks better than it did before.

A few days ago, I finally emptied my bedroom of every single item I didn't want in it. Seriously, there was nothing in the bedroom I didn't want there. I was thrilled and it felt great to have it look tidy, spacious, even a bit bare.

But it was a depressing color, so I bought a quart of periwinkle paint and spent eight hours painting. It is phenomenal. It's so clean and it's a very pretty color, soothing, relaxing, just dark enough to feel like a hideaway, but not dark enough to be depressing.

Now I'm inspired to paint the rest of the rooms. One at a time, only when I get the room to the point there's nothing in it I don't want there, so I can easily move the furniture and objects around.

I can't wait for the next one, which is going to be the living room. Next after that is the kitchen, then the dining room.

A few days ago, I finally emptied my bedroom of everything I didn't want there. The room looked tidy, spacious, even a bit bare.

But it was a depressing color, so I bought some periwinkle paint and spent eight hours painting. It is phenomenal. It's clean and it is a beautiful shade.

Now I'm inspired to paint the rest of the rooms. One at a time, only when I get the room to the point there's nothing in it I don't want there, so I can easily move furniture and objects around.

Next is going to be the living room, then the kitchen, then the dining room.

When I first got the house, I wanted to paint, but it was impossible with all the clutter, so this feels like a real accomplishment.

There are also some small repairs I've made that couldn't be done before.

It's finally starting to feel like my house, not my family's house that I live in. And I'm also starting to feel like I'm not living with dead people any more.

I may not keep it periwinkle, but it is a fun and cheerful change for now, so even if I ultimately decide go back to a lighter, more normal hue, it will have been nice to have this lovely color as a mood-enhancer, if only temporarily.",0

Finally donated half the china!,"A few years ago my MIL kindly gave us her old dinner service. All twelve settings, with *all* the extras! She never used it and wanted to get rid of it. We live in a very small space so most of it has been lurking in boxes. Today I finished sorting through it all and put half of it away properly, and the rest (6 settings plus teapot, coffeepot etc.) went to the local charity shop who were very excited to have such a large donation of good quality china. It is such a relief to have it gone and not cluttering up the place!

Husband and I disagree on plates,"Tl;dr What do you do when you and your spouse are at a stand still about which of your duplicate items to keep? 


When my husband and I got married, instead of registering for fancy China, we registered for pottery from a local studio in our hometown. We picked out the colors we wanted and designed the plates, bowl, mugs, platters, casserole dishes, etc just the way we wanted them. Each piece was specifically made for us. As you can imagine, the stuff was expensive but we still got a lot of it as gifts from family and friends. 


Over the years, we decided we needed to get new plates (since we were forever washing the 4 plates we had). Adding more pottery to our collection was out of our budget, so we picked up 4 new sets of dishes from a big box store. The new dishes are different from the pottery, but we loved both and used them interchangeably. 


A few years after that, we had a decorative piece of pottery get broken. Since we don’t live in our hometown, my father-in-law took the broken pieces back to the studio, and they remade the platter for us. Unbeknownst to us, the studio still had several pieces from our wedding registry and offered to make us a deal on the rest of it. He bought everything left and gifted it to me at Christmas. I think I cried when I opened it I was so excited. 


It’s been a few years since that Christmas, and I still have two sets of dishes in my cabinet - enough for a party of 12. If we ever have that many people over, we use disposable plates. As much as I love the stuff we got from the big box store, I love my pottery more. However, my husband firmly disagrees. He likes the set from the big box store better. How do we compromise? I don’t really have the shelf space to keep both sets. (I guess I could make it if I wanted to.) I don’t like the idea of just decorating with the pottery. Should we switch it out with the seasons? (The pottery is darker and the other set if brighter. Use one for spring/summer and the other for fall/winter? That seems over complicated.) How have you dealt with similar situations?

"Couldn't find a much-needed item today, made me hit the breaking point","I will apologize in advance for ranting a bit, but I am just at the end of my rope right now.

Without getting into a long story, let's just say that the basement of my home is both a storage area and my ""man cave"" of sorts. It has long been the bane of my existence for decluttering.

Bathroom is still clean. Here's how.,"It's not like my bathroom was terrible to begin with, just like zero organization.

I picked up a free ikea cabinet from Craigslist and got busy.

my place is a converted Victorian hotel, so the bathroom is a multi-generational hodgepodge of wacky design. Adding the narrow Ikea cabinet wasn't exactly a design WIN, but my thinking here was: ""SOME organization is better than NONE.""

I've been struggling with depression, so I broke it down: 

Step 1 get cabinet. Clean it. Done!

Step 2: throw it all into the cabinet in ""general sections"".  I made the top part DAILY STUFF I USE and the bottom OTHER STUFF. Real broad. I know. It helped. A LOT.

Step 3: Toss all the expired shit. I had to do this a different day. Only rule? If there's a date on it, and it's expired, it goes in the trash. EASILY HALVED the value of stuff. Things got real clear, in terms of what I had, what I used, and what needed to happen with it.

STEP 4: ATTRITION. Merely using everything until it was gone. GONE. Used up. Consumed. Then OUT. I had 4 different shampoos. Now I've got 2. Used 100% of the 3 extra bottles of lotion. Now I have 1. I wrote a small list of the stuff I had lots of in my bathroom on a business card and put it in my wallet. When I go shopping, I check if what's in the cart is on my bathroom list. Simply NOT BUYING MORE SHIT has dramatically decluttered for me.

Step 5: No, I don't want that. 
I don't accept gifts of shit from others. EVER. Not even to be polite anymore. No, I don't want your bathbombs. No, I don't need a lipstick caddy. No, you can keep your caboodle. I be super nice about it. But no. No more. Shit. 

Step 6: Arbitrary OCD about 2 specific areas. 
I accept decluttering doesn't come natural to me. It never will. But I will draw 2 hard lines: My sink and the toilet. I REFUSE to leave ANYTHING on the sink. NOTHING is to be there. Just the sink. Hygiene stuff has a place. Toilet MUST be cleaned once a week. These are my 2 hard lines. Everything else can get a little messy, I'll forgive the clothes on the floor every now and then. I'll forgive the tub needing a wipe down. But these 2 things I hold myself to. Maybe next year when I've got the habit developed I'll add in the flooring and the tub. But it's more about forming a habit right now and sticking to it.

It works for me. Maybe it works for you.

I did it: scanned 2 years of receipts.,"Saw a few posts about handling paper and felt BOLD. I also missed my train to a show I wanted to go to. So it became receipt night.

I bought some scotch tape, grabbed the ""misprint/scratch"" printer papers and a jar of receipts. (I have 6 pickle jars of receipts. 1 jar per year.)

Then I used an HIIT timer on my phone to do 20 minute ""sets"" of taping the receipts to the scratch paper.

I nailed a year's worth of receipts in an hour. Just taping receipts to paper one after the other. A few hundred of them total, I worked out something of a rhythm and it was done.

They're in a used automatic feed scanner right now. Scanning slowly. SLOW AS HELL. But I'm done. The scans are good.

I am now headed to grab a pizza and beer to celebrate my forthcoming receipt-lessness. By the time I get back home in 40 minutes, these should all be scanned in.

I don't know why I was so freaked about handling the recepts. There were less than I thought. I found $16 in rolled up bills mixed in with receipts, thus the beer and pizza money.

I learned... I shouldn't wad up my receipts. I think I'll just fold and jam them sideways into the jars from now on. And scan them maybe monthly. I also learned that this jar system works for me. They're all in one spot, which is more than I can say for... a lot of papers. So, I'm keeping up this habit because it works for me. I also learned I spent under $200 on beer in all of 2014 -- further evidence of an ex who gaslit me that year and called me an alcoholic relentlessly... when on average I bought 1 beer roughly every 3 to 5 weeks. I felt terrible for so long... the receipts are conclusive evidence that no, I had a lower than average consumption of beer. It's refreshing. I feel vindicated.

I got free pickle jars from who knows where and when. They are the tacky glass, but very large and putting the current year jar under where i throw my wallet has provided an easy/lazy/basic filing system of sorts. It *was* clutter. Now that I'm SCANNING them and using the data... it's now a filing system, not clutter.

I'm getting a huge shelf back for storage if I can finish the remaining jars by weeks end and throw out all but 3 of them.

Feels good! Tomorrow I'll check off each paper receipt after confirming the scan was successful before I throw the paper out. I can't wait to get this out.

Going too far the other way - compulsive decluttering,"I am wondering if anyone has found themselves becoming addicted to de-cluttering in a way that some might deem to be ""unhealthy"".

Decluttering is wearing me out. Why is this process so ridiculously draining?,"My mother's house is being redone, I'm moving an hour+ away, my dad just bought a house and he sold his commercial property and has to out in 4 days. I'm working my tail off to get rid of junk. For the last two weeks, I've filled my car up completely every single day to take things to donate or recycle. I already have boxes and bags stacked ready for the next trip. I've been plowing through heaps of crap like a bulldozer. I was feeling good at first but I've hit the wall. Yesterday I was slowing down, I didn't finish loading my car in time to make it to goodwill. I drank two red bulls yesterday and coffee and was still sluggish. I work a physical job and packing/cleaning is nothing compared to normal work day, so I know it's not a physical thing. Also, I took a month off between jobs to handle all the moveing so I'm not overworked or anything like that. I'm not sore or physically worn out but I can't make myself move. Today I have done nothing but eat carryout and stare at the wall. I just got burned out and now I'm getting frustrated because we're in a time crunch and I'm just sitting around. I complained to my friend about my poor progress today and he responded with ""come on man, just get up and do something"". It hurt to hear, and I get it... the solution to my problem is pretty simple, but if you've never had to do this you dont know how awful it can be. I just dont have it in me to keep going, it's like all the motivation was sucked out of me. I took care of all the easy/big things and now I'm down to the more tedious stuff. I can't explain what exactly it is, but there is something so exhausting about this process. I've basically tapped out mentally and feel like I should just relax because I know I'll regret my decisions. Because right now, I want to throw everything out, or just light my whole house on fire and call it quits. Everyone talks about how great it feels to declutter and how it's such a stress relief. I think we also have to be honest about the emotional toll it takes on a person to actually make it through a lifetime of belongings. I keep thinking about memories and people I've forgotten, people I've lost, high school and college memories... digging through what I assumed was just ""crap"" is proving to be really hard. I mean yeah, when I move into my new house is it going to feel good with less clutter, of course. I know I'll reap the benefits of my hard work later, but holy cow does it sure suck right now. I would not recommend trying to do this with a hard deadline to anyone, how is it even possible to stay sane? I feel like I need a shrink and some cigarettes.

Slow and Steady (bonus: Going to college in the fall? Declutter beforehand! Future-you will thank you.),"My decluttering journey has been a long one. I had undiagnosed ADHD until last year (in my twenties but luckily I could mask a lot of the symptoms growing up) and I had accumulated an early-life mini-hoard. I've done multiple rounds of decluttering over the last 3 months to whittle away things in my life. I know that there is no way that I would have been able to do one giant declutter and then create good habits from then on. Instead, each week has been about reinforcing good behaviours and avoiding *adding* to my personal collection unless there is a good reason. If something else can be removed or replaced by the new addition, even better. 

Round 1: Konmari #1

* Not the best option for a person with ADHD. Lots of things bring me joy while they remain interesting to me. The problem is how items relating to my hobbies and sports collect, therefore taking up a good chunk of space. 

Round 2: Academic Declutter #1

* I switched programs partway through college and ended up taking a minor for the first program. I had planned to graduate this spring so I discarded old textbooks/notes/medium-quality papers.

Round 3: Aesthetic Declutter

* I'm planning to move cities again soon so I took some time to discard items that I wouldn't be bringing with me and also wouldn't be putting into storage with my family. I have developed a very specific sense of fashion and home style so anything that didn't fit/couldn't be modified to fit the look of the new space was donated.

Round 4: Academic Declutter #2

* I'm graduating a few months later because of an amazing academic opportunity. I went through everything, for all of the courses I took for my major/minor/electives/extracurricular associations and discarded a significant majority of the hard copies of these materials. 

Round 5: Fashion Declutter

* I lost over 50lbs over a period of six months. Needless to say, much of my wardrobe was no longer flattering. Luckily, I've been working on creating a capsule wardrobe so donating lots of clothes because they no longer fit removes the 'maybe I'll wear this again' guilt. 

Each formal declutter happened every second or third week. I'd spend at least 10 minutes a day tackling a ""section"" of my space/a certain collection like makeup or my embroidery supplies/a specific box on the weeks that didn't have a longer declutter session. 

If you're on your way, keep going! I'm down to 5 boxes in storage (treasured items like my prom dress in a vacuum shrunk bag and useful items in the new apartment like my blender, my Rubbermaid containers/cookware/dinnerware), a single bookshelf, a small desk, 4 drawers of clothes, and a tiny closet. I would have started, if everything had been put into boxes, with at least 40 boxes of stuff. 

BIG ADVICE FOR ANY STUDENTS GOING TO COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY THIS FALL: Do a really, really good declutter before you move. Enough so that you have extra storage space despite being away. You are going to collect items while living in residence or off-campus that are a part of your total 'collection'.

Save for yard sale or donate today?,"I have a house full of clutter. I already started going through it and I'm about to embark on the whole Konmari thing. I just don't know if I should get rid of it all immediately via dropping of at a charity shop or if I should continue to collect all the junk for a yard sale. 

I live in a very strict community and we cannot have yard sales whenever, only twice a year and the next one is in September. I've participated in the past and always make at least a few hundred which is nice for a mornings' work. But the boxes of yard sale stuff are starting to get to me. 

A lot of it isn't even my junk. My mom seriously downsized and a lot of it ended up being stored at my home. She only recently started going through the boxes and about 75% is heading to the donate/yard sale pile. 

So while a couple hundred dollars is tempting the boxes, and I've got several large ones already, feel like they are still cluttering up my space. I am a single mom and public school teacher, so I don't exactly have money to spare but my mental health is worth something as well.

Does anyone else use decluttering as a way to reduce stress?,"For the past several years I’ve noticed a pattern in myself where when I get really stressed out and overwhelmed I’ll do some major decluttering. The triggers are different, fights with my mom or significant other, stress and anxiety related to school/ workload, my declining grandparents, etc. but when I start to just get emotionally choked up or flustered and feel like I’m going to burst I go into this huge purging of my environment. 


It feels so good to throw away old school notes, make up, hair products, worn out clothes, just whatever doesn’t hold much value anymore. Also just little things that build up like mail or receipts or something like that. I usually end up reorganizing things in a way that feels more efficient and by the end of it I really do feel a huge release, like I’m super light and so satisfied with myself. 


I don’t always declutter for this reason. I try to go through my closet or desk at least every six months to get rid of things I feel are unnecessary and just taking up space. 
It’s kind funny because at this point you can tell when I’m feeling carefree, relaxed, and just loving life because my room gets pretty messy. 


Maybe this is an odd behavior, but I don’t view it particularly negative or destructive in my life. I was talking about it to my mom the other day and she said something along the lines of “Wow that’s so good that you can just get rid of stuff so easily”

I have a whole home to go through and a serious case of ""it might be important later"" but it needs to be done for my mental state and so living here actually feels like a home.

2. For those that are parents - how do you reason getting rid of your children's possessions and things that (may) have sentimental value for them? - my children have way too much stuff for the small home we have and would be able to play much easier if they had less of it, plus I want to encourage having space over hoarding/accumulating but they seem so attached to it all.

So many toys!! I hate to throw away and waste but it takes forever to find the pieces.,"I cannot overcome this. We have so many toys and they are scattered EVERYWHERE. 
It feels so wasteful to throw away perfectly good toys that my children no longer use but it takes forever to find all the pieces.

I should be using my debilitating phobia to fix my clutter problem!,"I am sitting at home waiting for my SO to come home when he's done with work to kill a big roach in our bathroom.

Having said all that, how in the HELL have I gone on all these years with a chronic clutter problem?

For people who want to declutter but hate throwing things in landfill,"The prevailing wisdom for decluttering is to just get the stuff you no longer want out of your house. Don’t hoard it in a box for a car boot in six months’ time, don’t try and sell it all, just get it gone. 

I subscribe to that, BUT, I also know people who just can’t bring themselves to do that, especially when the object isn’t resellable so a charity can’t take, so it’ll have to go to landfill.  

I wanted to share my experience about what kind of stuff I’ve managed to rehome and thus avoid landfill for one more cycle of its life via freecycle (but could also be via gumtree or Craigslist free listings etc).  This is stuff that you can’t sell and might think will have to go to the tip, but someone out there might want it!

- A portable cassette player, likely broken

- a chair in need of completely reupholstering (a nice lady took it as a project for an upholstery course she was taking)

- several sets of old, grotty shelves (went to a chap with a large garage)

- a garage door

- old concrete slabs

- used nail varnishes 

- a cat toy

- opened washing powder

- half a pack of wall tiles 

- random assorted pet food pouches 

- a slightly damaged picture frame 

- a broken Xbox

- an old, pilled blanket (went to someone’s dog)

- an open bottle of car cleaner

- old food jars with lids

- an opened bottle of pen ink

- random unused envelopes

- an old, damanged dresser that a charity shop rejected for resale

Dropped off a box for recycling today,"Even though it was only one box, I feel great! I know, baby steps.  


It was a heavy box of car parts from a repair back in 2016. For some reason the mechanic gave it back to us. It’s been chilling in our storage unit (and then our garage) since then. Part of me wanted to keep it since I thought it could be reused, but last summer I posted it on Craigslist and no one showed interest. 

I accepted that it’s not really usable and so today I dropped it off at Auto Zone for free, for them to dispose.

Getting rid of sentimental toys?,"I am probably just looking for ""permission"" but wanted to get thoughts on this... 

When I (female) was growing up, my parents would get me a Precious Moments doll every year for Christmas. It was a little tradition and they thought they'd turn out to be collectibles. I had them sitting on a shelf for years until I went to college. When I moved out, my parents put the dolls back into their cardboard boxes and stored them. They made me take them when I finally got married and had a place of my own. 

We don't live in a very big house and these dolls are taking up room in a closet. They aren't in great shape and they aren't collectibles like once thought (they go for $10ish each on Ebay). I will probably never display them as I have a minimalist aesthetic AND I don't really care to look at Precious Moments dolls all the time. Also, we are about to have a kid (a little boy) and we could really use the storage space.

My Closet Overhaul,"I have been cleaning my apartment off and on since November and finally finished my closet this weekend. I have been living in my apartment for about 7 years, accumulating and accumulating, but never purging ""just in case"" I may need something again. My clothing was no different. My weight and personal style had frequent changes over the years and I kept stuff in case anything changed back, but it never did. What I did notice over the years was that I was more drawn to darker colors in a basic and comfortable style, so I downsized to just those things. I also used my closet for storage space. My apartment isn't very big, less than 600sqft, but the closet is a walk-in. I had three sets of plastic drawers full of clothes and accessories, and two large tubs full of other junk. One of my shelves held extra bedding for when my family visited, and it wasn't very stable because of the weight which resulted in having to use wood to prop it up. Unfortunately I don't have a pic from before I started, but the mid-progression pic isn't too far off from what it was. [I'm pretty proud of the end result](https://imgur.com/a/uzJbuf6).

Update on The Cleansing Fire Yard Sale Route,"The yard sale was supposed to be two weeks ago. But due to rain leading to some flooding issues, the community moved it to tomorrow.

So I’ve had some extra time to sort out things. Which means the sell pile literally tripled in size. 

I’m feeling pretty good about everything. 

I took everyone’s suggestions and have been working hard to make them work. 

1. I have multiple tables to put things upon
2. I’ve come to terms that some items might not sell and how to handle their futures
3. I bought bags for Fill Bags stuff (a lot of it is jewelry pieces so I have smaller size bags)
4. I’ve listened to the book that was recommended, it’s a good book
5. I put advertisements everywhere I could think of, granted the ads are lacking on pictures but I don’t really have space to take good photos of everything.
6. I talked to some people about how to handle the empty space that hopefully will occur so I don’t feel the need to reclutter 



Next, I’ll be cleaning off the driveway so there is room for a yard sale. (Well that’s really just me cleaning up pine needles)

I got sunblock so I don’t burn from being outside for hours tomorrow 

I’ve already decided where any acquired money goes, so I don’t have the burning a hole in the wallet sensation.

So the rest of today’s plan is to finish cleaning up trash, set everything up so it’s easy to get out in the morning, and see what else can go.

**Am I forgetting anything?**

**How do you guys handle newly decluttered spaces? **

**how do I keep a space clean after decluttering? (As in how do I fight the urge to wreck the space?)**

I did it...I finally did the Room.,"I've been putting off cleaning out this room for two years. It was my mom's sewing/costume storage room before she passed away. I never thought I'd see it clean; I'm seriously surprised I did it today.

It took about five hours. I would clean for 20 mins and then take a break for 10 mins. I'm allergic to dust, so I needed to give myself time to breathe. 

I found a home for all of her costumes and a separate home for all of the crafting/fabric things. 

My ears are ringing. Time for a nap.

Family Matters,"My S.O. and I bought a house from his grandmother for really cheap with the idea to fix it up and sell it eventually. 

However, we inherited all of her junk with the house. 

That’s not a huge deal, we just moved everything into the garage and have been selling/ donating stuff and having yard sales as often as possible. 

But then other family members from that side started saying things like “Oh do you have this art I made in the 5th grade and haven’t thought about in 40 years? Yeah keep that for me, I’ll come get it eventually.”

So we had a huge clutter room full of crap that we don’t want whatsoever and can’t get rid of.

What do you do when decluttering is a potential (minor) health hazard?,"I’m a university student home at my parents’ place for the summer and am hoping to do a massive clean out of my childhood room while here.

My study is a total mess - and I'm happy about that today,"Because I can actually get into it. There aren't papers all over the floor, junk everywhere, piles of stuff collapsing if you so much as blink at it, drawers stuffed with things I've long forgotten...

It's taken two days to get it to the point where I consider it merely a mess. Four sacks of rubbish, one pile of donations, and two sacks of old electronics traded in. Rubbish taken to the tip; donations taken to the Re-Use shop they have next to the tip; old consoles, controllers, games etc. tested and then taken to an electronics trading shop where I handed in the lot and got a PS4 and Xbox One in return - 80% paid for purely from the proceeds of trading. Nice thing about current generation consoles? Download the games - no discs to float around the house and get damaged, strewn about the place and generally looking bad.


It's going to take another two or three days before I can claim 'tamed', and those days are likely going to be another weekend because after a solid Friday and Saturday I could do with a break. But I now have a messy room, not something to view with total revulsion.

We started tackling the storage closet!,"... one of the last remaining places to declutter. 

After decluttering to move, moving in and decluttering some more, packing everything up to renovate, unpacking again (and decluttering again) .... we just ran out of steam. So this storage closet was put on hold, as have two other spaces (a small loft space and our storage unit). 

It's been on hold for year. DH and I just did not have the energy or enthusiasm to tackle these last remaining spaces, especially because all three are awkward, and not the easiest to access. 

It's not just decluttering: the storage closet and the loft both need renovating, which we plan to do ourselves. Rip up ugly old gross carpet and install flooring. Spackle and paint. Add better lighting. Add intelligent storage -- once we've decluttered and figured out what remains that we need to store in there. 

The loft won't be for storage - it'll become a fun little reading nook eventually. Right now the loft is packed with DH's tools, looks like a disorganized hardware store. Those will eventually find a home inside the storage closet and/or storage unit. 

Yesterday DH took the initiative to start chipping away at the decluttering of the closet. He pulled out a couple of boxes and went through them without me -- usually I do the sorting, so that is major! He then let me take a look if there was anything I wanted before he hauled them off. 

One box was full of toiletries/medicine/bathroom sort of stuff, and I was pretty sure all of it was expired at this point. I saved a pair of toenail clippers -- as I had no idea where those had gone to. The other box had a bunch of random items from our previous home's patio and we didn't need any of it. Truth is, anything we might've needed we'd already replaced. Sigh.

We also had a ton of cleaning supplies, mostly stuff we are never going to use as it's for surfaces in our last place (like granite cleaner) which we don't have in our new place. We need to figure out how to handle these items as we can't just put them in the trash. 

There was also an old and totally groady cooler that was stuffed with a zillion bottles of bug spray which had leaked all over the cooler. 

And some leftover material from our renovation that we're likely never going to need. 

We still have a lot to go through but doing it a few boxes at a time won't be that difficult. Once we've sorted and pared it all down then DH can renovate the space and I'll flip into action coming up with a plan for how we'll organize and store whatever we're keeping. Seasonal items (deck sofa pillows, beach gear, xmas decorations), stash of wrapping paper, tools, touch-up paint, air mattress. It's a great closet for bulky occasional use items. Not sure what else ---as frankly, I can barely remember what we stashed in there in the first place!

Old cat finds new place!,"[There has NEVER been room on this shelf before!](https://i.imgur.com/qCRPjAc.jpg)

I did get get rid of a bunch of stuff but... I did a decluttering faux pas: I mounted new bathroom shelves before I was done decluttering, and moved the ""save"" stuff to my new shelves. For good reason, it is not recommended that you add new storage space until you are closer to the end of the decluttering process.

How do you resist the urge to do home improvement projects when your real goal is to declutter? I think the reason I am tempted by the home improvement projects is that they are basically non-emotional tasks. 

What about cleaning? Does anyone get distracted by cleaning when a space starts clearing up? I also procrastinate-clean in other areas of life, but with decluttering the temptation is much stronger cause I'm up close and personal with the dirt.

How do I motivate my mom to declutter her house?,"I recently started really living with my mom for the first time in years. After she and my dad broke up, she moved back into her one story 2BR 1BA house, bringing massive amounts of stuff from the 3 story 4BR 3BA house we previously lived in together as a family. The move happened 6 years ago. I swear the place has never been clean mostly due to the fact that she simply has too much stuff and no space to put it. 

You can barely walk through the house without stepping on something– the floors are absolutely covered with stuff except for small paths that have worn in due to the common walking paths we use to get between rooms. I can’t sit down on the couch or chair in the living room because they are covered with junk. Only one person can sit at the kitchen table at a time because the table and chairs are covered and we can’t move them because of other things in the way. I have to share a room with my 7yo sister here– in our room, the only space that isn’t covered with toys or clothes is the area beneath my loft bed. We also have a sunroom, or rather, junk room filled with bursted boxes and piles of stuff. You can’t take two steps past the door before meeting the blockade of junk that has not been touched in years now.

It makes me sad every time I walk in the front door to be greeted by piles of junk that I can tell haven’t been touched in weeks, maybe months. I feel that just about none of this stuff would be missed if it just disappeared, seeing as my mom hasn’t done anything with it for years and therefore doesn’t seem to need it. 

When I didn’t live with her, I had very little motivation to help clean whenever I visited because  whatever I did would be completely undone once I left and came back again. Now, I have to stay with her because my university and job are close to her house and I would like to save money for a while before permanently moving out. Simply put, I hate seeing all this junk everyday. I made some progress by cleaning her kitchen. It didn’t take much just to put things away and throw out all the rotten food and moldy containers. The other rooms, however, I cannot tackle without her help. The main problem there is that she is a teacher and single mother, and she is usually too tired to do much when she gets home. She says that working on cleaning would tire her out even more, causing her to be exhausted the next day. 

Despite the huge mess, I don’t believe that the task of cleaning is as daunting as she seems to think, especially if we work together.

Getting rid of shelves/shelving units to reduce clutter?,"Hi there everyone. As with others here, I am in a constant battle to reduce both clutter and possessions in my life. The basement of my home has been a source of stress for me for quite some time now. I have been working steadily to declutter it and have made some process.

One thing I wrestle back and forth with is getting rid of shelves and shelving units in my basement as a means to free up space. I figure that doing so has a few benefits. One, by having less shelves and shelving units, there is more overall space in the basement. Two, having less places to store stuff encourages me to get rid of stuff that I normally would have kept on the shelves.

Childhood item decluttering today,"Hello

Today, one of my childhood items is going. It's a poster from Carry on Matron, which was a terrible British film franchise. I bought from the closing down sale of the Regal cinema, Henley on Thames, when I was 11 years old. 

I think prepubescent me liked the drawing of the leggy sixties nurse. It cost 50p, a whole week's pocket money!

I didn't enjoy my childhood. I've kept it because original 1960s film posters are supposed to be valuable, but it's never gone up on the wall of anywhere I've lived as an adult because I don't like it and I've never sold it because I'd make more money working than I would selling it. Perhaps they were innocent at the time, but I am embarrassed by Carry on Films nowadays. Racist, misogynist awfulness. People say they're a product of their time and you shouldn't judge them, but I think they normalise bad behaviour and attitudes.

I am going to put it in my brazier tonight, and have a beer while thinking about the future.",declutter,1527336224,iefuastrjrawfieb589,5,69,True,8m9q3u,2018-05-26,"Childhood item decluttering today Hello

Life changing decluttering strategies for me and maybe for others also,"Hi! I want to share with you some great tips for how to declutter your home but also your mind! 

A friend recommend me a Book about decluttering, is for free on Kindle\(the link is below\) 

I'm so glad that I read this short book, that change my perception about decluttering and I realize that is not impossible to have a clutter free home.

Here are some strategies that I learned in this book:

\-  decluttering isn’t just about cleaning house; it’s also about cleaning your mind. Take the weight off your brain, lift your mood, make you think clearer and truly concentrate on what matters the most. That is what decluttering is about.

\-   decluttering is about clearing the cobwebs from your brain, learning to focus on what is important and really, having a much easier life.

Stop! Don’t Accumulate Anymore!

To stop the clutter, you must stop the accumulation and that means you need to assess everything that you buy – carefully! If you can stop stuff coming into your home, you can stop the clutter building up. So, when you go shopping, you need to get into the mindset that each purchase requires more than just the price ticket – it will take time and energy once it comes into your home. Unless it is a vital item, before you buy anything, ask these questions:

· Do I really need this item?

· Where will I put it in my home?

· Will this possession add value to my life or will it just add more work?

· Why am I buying it?

"Instead of thinking in the long term, think of the short term. You'll see how things change value quickly.","Part of what makes decluttering so hard, from my experience, is that your relation to everything is probably thinking in the long term. When I say that, I think that most people believe they will stay in a given situation longer than they actually will. Traveling out of the USA for the first time made me realize how I could drop everything and I'd still be me. 

Growing up poor, I developed a habit of collecting things...it became a rainy day fund so to speak. I'll have 3 usb drivers and two old printers I'd barely used because I'd have backups just in case. I'd keep old tires in my house because my tire might pop in the next few years. 

It was hard to declutter because I had the ''might need it' mentality. One thing that has really helped \(now I'll preface this that I'm no longer poor so some of this is easier to apply now\) was that I asked myself if i'd use it in the next year OR how much would I be willing to give up to go to a new/dream city? Like if i had to move to London now, how much could I truly sell/throwaway/donate?

Now, too much short term thinking can be very dangerous. For example, I tend to buy better made clothes that should say last several winters rather than going to H&amp;M every year. But it helps me pause to think. If it's not something that will ultimately benefit me in the long run \(and is worth the hassle to tag along with me\) then I probably don't need it.

Have been tasked with clearing my mum's 'Barn'. Need a sorting shooting selling and sending system.,"Hello!

My mum isnt a hoarder, but she definately has held onto a lot of crap. and she buys a lot of crap. Since moving in with her husband she's a lot better, but mainly its down to the fact that the kids have moved out now and she has a bigger house, so it just *seems* less cluttered. Anyway, I'm coming home for a couple of weeks and she has said that 'Whatever £ you make from the barn you can keep'

This 'barn' is like a minature warehouse. Full of things such as furniture, clothes (lots of nice stuff actually. My mum likes shoes and handbags), stuff from when we were kids, electronics, all sorts. (But there is also a lot of crap.)

The task seems overwhelming but I want to get the most out of it. As I see it, each item needs to be evaluated and put into one of a number of catagories:

-Trash
-Value (Sellable)
-Value (Sentimental, to keep)
-Donatable

Once I have got rid of the trash and donated the donatables its a case of having a system of photographing, listing on ebay (or whatver means of sale we decide is appropriate for the item, i.e, antiques, used furniture) and dispatching.

I've created a flow chart that basically outlines that i've just said, do any of you have any systems or tricks for clearing out? 

Cheers!

Saving It to Sell/Donate Syndrome,"In my earliest bouts of decluttering in my teens - a decade or more before I would ever read *The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up* or *Unfuck Your Habitat* I found that the best (see: only) way to get rid of clutter without my hoarder/pack rat family being tempted to go through my stuff and keep things only for them to end up with me again later was **big black contractor bags**.

You know? The big trash bags you use when you're doing yardwork or a mega clean up. It wasn't just the size, it was the fact that they were thick and opaque so no one knew or cared what I was tossing. Because if I used regular bags my mom and sister would swoop in to tell me how nice something was and why I should keep it. Keep it because we would eventually have a yard sale. Keep it to donate. Keep. Keep. Keep. 

It is my firm belief that you cannot assign value to other people's belongings, but similarly, you can't allow others to assign value to your belongings. 

To put it simply *if you think it's junk and you are ready to get rid of it- I mean really get rid of it- then you don't need the peanut gallery there to tell you that everything you're throwing away could be sold or donated.*

There's a yard sale culture that I don't know a ton about but I know it involves the type of person that's actually organized enough to know their inventory, and get up every nice weekend and set up their tables and sell. There are yard salers that go out and acquire things simply to upgrade them and sell them. 

But the worst kind of yard saler is the one with a house, garage, basement, or storage unit filled with stuff that they'll ""eventually"" sell. 

Pro tip: *Eventually* eventually becomes *never*. 

And there your car sits in the driveway waiting for you to eventually have that yard sale. The things that at one point may have held value, deteriorate and decay. They become covered in dust and spider webs. In some cases animals like rats and mice make homes in your cardboard boxes, complete with indoor plumbing if you catch my drift. 

*BUT I'M GOING TO DONATE IT!* You argue. 

And that bag of towels to go to the animal shelter sits in your kitchen for when you *eventually* make it there to donate. 

That stack of books sits in a box in the living room waiting to go to the library. *Eventually.*

If you are waiting for *eventually* to happen, you have two options right now: **Do it or don't.**

Option one is do it. Get all those boxes, or put together the boxes of things you're going to sell or donate and do it. This week. Make some yard sale signs with all those extra craft supplies. Put an ad up on Craig's List. But if you're going to do it, then do it. And anything that's not sold or donated, *you have to throw it away.*

Option two, is to not do it. If you know and can admit to yourself that you do not have the motivation, the momentum, or the time to have a yard sale or make it to a donation center, then bag up your junk in contractor bags, set it to the curb for trash pickup, and *forgive yourself*.

We all end up with things we really didn't need. You might feel guilty that you never used it, or for how expensive it was. And frankly if it wasn't being taken care of it doesn't matter how expensive it was- you can render an object utterly worthless simply by not maintaining it. 

If you're not using it, and you don't love it now, then it's just taking up space in your home for things you actually do care about.

Please, let go ",declutter,1527611472,uppercnt,32,118,True,8n0h2y,2018-05-29,"Saving It to Sell/Donate Syndrome In my earliest bouts of decluttering in my teens - a decade or more before I would ever read *The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up* or *Unfuck Your Habitat* I found that the best (see: only) way to get rid of clutter without my hoarder/pack rat family being tempted to go through my stuff and keep things only for them to end up with me again later was **big black contractor bags**.

You know? The big trash bags you use when you're doing yardwork or a mega clean up. It wasn't just the size, it was the fact that they were thick and opaque so no one knew or cared what I was tossing. Because if I used regular bags my mom and sister would swoop in to tell me how nice something was and why I should keep it. Keep it because we would eventually have a yard sale. Keep it to donate. Keep. Keep. Keep. 

It is my firm belief that you cannot assign value to other people's belongings, but similarly, you can't allow others to assign value to your belongings. 

To put it simply *if you think it's junk and you are ready to get rid of it- I mean really get rid of it- then you don't need the peanut gallery there to tell you that everything you're throwing away could be sold or donated.*

There's a yard sale culture that I don't know a ton about but I know it involves the type of person that's actually organized enough to know their inventory, and get up every nice weekend and set up their tables and sell. There are yard salers that go out and acquire things simply to upgrade them and sell them. 

But the worst kind of yard saler is the one with a house, garage, basement, or storage unit filled with stuff that they'll ""eventually"" sell. 

Pro tip: *Eventually* eventually becomes *never*. 

And there your car sits in the driveway waiting for you to eventually have that yard sale. The things that at one point may have held value, deteriorate and decay. They become covered in dust and spider webs. In some cases animals like rats and mice make homes in your cardboard boxes, complete with indoor plumbing if you catch my drift. 

*BUT I'M GOING TO DONATE IT!* You argue. 

And that bag of towels to go to the animal shelter sits in your kitchen for when you *eventually* make it there to donate. 

That stack of books sits in a box in the living room waiting to go to the library. *Eventually.*

If you are waiting for *eventually* to happen, you have two options right now: **Do it or don't.**

I did it! Two ikea bags of books/dvds and 3 bags of stuff is going..,"My wife and I are in the middle of decluttering our house to completely restyle it and find some peace. This weekend we took a plastic tote and 2 IKEA bags full of books and media to Half Price. I want to get a large 5-shelf bookshelf instead of the small ones we have but I felt like I could and should cull the books before I did.

The Goodwill was closed when we got there, but we have 1 bag in the trunk to take to the drive-thru Goodwill donation center, plus 2 more in the house. We're probably going to get to 5 bags soon. 

Up next is the kitchen to get rid of extra mugs, pots, etc, then tackling my 80's toys to sell them and get new carpet with the funds, plus getting rid of clothes that don't fit, and cleaning out our hutch and TV console. 

Thanks for the inspiration in this subreddit!

Decluttering paradox: it’s easier to get rid of stuff that I use,"I’ve decluttered a ton of clothes over the weekend. One thing that struck me is how easy it was to give up dresses that I’ve loved and worn so much they’re getting ratty. But that blazer that I’ve barely touched? Oh I’d better hold on to it, just in case. I’m sure the perfect occasion will arise.

I imagine the guilt of having bought something that proved to be so useless makes me cling to these items even more. It can also be that by never having used these items, I’ve never put them to “the test”. This blazer _could_ make me feel fabulous or frumpy! But at the moment it’s an unknown and that makes it really hard to make a decision about.

I’ve decluttered!,"We’re moving house this week and I’ve taken about 10 bags of clothes and other textiles (old towels, bedlinen) for charity and recycling. I’ve donated a small table, a shelf unit, a computer desk and chair. Three boxes of toys have gone, all donated. Three boxes of books too. A bag of CDs. I’ve sold two bikes, car seats, and dumped an old pushchair/stroller.  I’ve recycled a huge pile of papers. Other junk has gone; old shoes and bags, some kitchen equipment, framed pictures.  
I know it’s an ongoing process, I have more clothes than I will ever wear, some that don’t even fit, but I have made amazing progress these last few weeks and I wanted to share with people who understand how difficult but rewarding this is in equal measure.  I want to move forward with a clearer, less cluttered life and teach my children a healthy attitude to their belongings too. I just wish it wasn’t so difficult.

How to deal with stuff that comes along with my purchases?,"When buying something, one usually gets the item, a box, instruction sheet/booklet/manual, a receipt, sometimes a card of guarantee, also possibly some spare parts and assembly instructions.

Random thoughts about decluttering.,"My best friend died Tony last year. He was a terrible hoarder to the extent that there was a BBC documentary about him, although neither of those facts are what I want you to think about when I talk about him. Tony was funny, kind and clever.

I was named as executor in his Will, and had the dubious privilege of clearing his large house.

Tony couldn't bear to get rid of things, to the extent that when he became ill you had to make a path through it all to get anywhere in the house. Some rooms were physically impossible to get into (one room was inexplicably full of CRT TV sets).

Why am I telling you this? If you are holding onto things because you can't bear to get rid of them I want you to know something. My friend's stuff really made him miserable in the end, and after he died it became a massive liability for his children. I have had to pay a company more than his car sold for to dump it all.

Don't be like Tony.

How I’m Dealing with DVDs/CDs,"I work in IT and I am also very minimalistic in nature. For years, I’ve hung onto to CDs despite having them ripped to my computer, added to my iPhone and additionally added to my computer’s backup drive. Recently I bought a Mac after being a Windows guy for eons which wasn’t a huge learning curve since I’ve used a Mac for work for awhile.

Anyways, I’m planning a garage sale soon. The first step is done, the girlfriend and I have officially decluttered our closets (which on a side note, we found a way to find out which clothes we don’t use by flipping the hangers in the opposite direction and revisiting the clothes that are hung that way in 6 months and getting rid of them if they haven’t been worn).

Back to our digital/physical struggle, we have tons of old CDs and DVDs that we are wanting to compress and ultimately sell at the garage sale while giving us tons of drawer/shelf space back but also maintain a backup of our music and movies for personal use. Since my Mac doesn’t have a DVD drive, I went out and purchased an LG DVD Writer SP80 along with 2 Seagate 2TB external drives. I’ve formatted the drives to exFat so that the drives will be interchangeable with both Windows and Mac. I bought two so that my girlfriend can have her drive and I have mine (it’s also a backup system if one goes bad). I’ve looked online and have researched that Handbreak is the best option for converting DVDs to a digital format but I have yet to give it a try though it’s on my list for this week. Since most of my music is already on my computer, I’m doing a drag and drop from there to the external drive, confirming the entire album was moved to the drive and then putting it the the garage sale box.

I’ll be doing the same with the DVDs, once I figure that system out. This is also incredibly useful to us because we can plug one of the external drives into the Roku and have all of our media available at the touch of a few buttons.

Fine Tuning and Taking Memory Pictures,"So I have done the massive declutter on my house a few years ago (took a few years) and I have basically tackled any remaining problem areas since (toiletries, linens, clothing) as well as done a few ""maintenance"" declutters to maintain the tidy! 

I furnished my house / decor / dishes with all vintage items as that's my jam. 2018 is the year where I am doing a massive repaint of the inside of my house as well as swapping out a lot of my vintage furniture for different vintage furniture for a complete decor refresh. I am making money along the way as I am selling everything for more then I originally paid for it and I am buying new vintage items for much less then what they are worth. 

All of this is good. 

I am now on the stage were I am fine tuning my beloved vintage decor items and really getting down to individual things that mean a lot to me or at one time were ""amazing"" finds that I am unlikely to find again for the price and quality. 

An example: I have a #3 Underwood typewriter that is just really cool looking however, it's a 50lb monster that I have never really done anything with. It's a massive dust magnet, hard to clean and is wasted in my house because I just don't have a good place for it. I found it for $5 and I have sold it for $150 to someone that is picking it up on Thursday. Today while dusting it, I got really nostalgic and am sorta having sellers remorse. 

So I cracked out my photography gear and I am going to do a photoshop of sorts. I swap my wall art quite a bit so adding a new funky picture to the mix is good. On one hand I feel good I am making money, decluttering items more, that I will take the time to photograph it creatively but, I also still feel a little heartache. 

Anyone else feel like this when they really get to the fine tuning part? How do you move forward and is regret a sign that maybe I am fine tuning too much? 

My house really is very tidy and once I finish the 2018 decor redo it will actually be a little more empty as some furniture I have sold and will not be replacing. So the actual decluttering aspect is really only about removing items I don't take advantage of and don't truly need - but I do have space for them still without them causing clutter. 

It's almost moving to a touch of the minimalism mindset, if I don't need it, why I am I keeping it and spending time caring for something that is just a thing.

guilty about the wasted money?,"When I was 12\-14 years old my mum had a lot more money than she does now, and considering my dad died she felt like she had to buy me all the stuff I wanted to make me feel better, this resulted in spending so much money on vinyl records.

What should I not throw away?,"Hello redditors, I need your help.

I would describe myself as pretty good at decluttering. About four years ago I started decluttering my life and since then I've thrown away a lot of stuff (e.g. old newspapers, old diaries, trophies, field day ribbons, kindergarten artwork, etc.). In the beginning I only started slowly but the more I threw away, the better I felt. Since starting to declutter my life I have never missed one of the things that I have thrown away.

A very long time ago (about 30 years) my grandparents have died and my parents still have all of their stuff. My parents are already quite old and of course I hope they become very old, but I started to think what I would do with all their stuff when they are not around anymore. **To be honest I would throw most of my parents' and grandparents' things away.** I know this sounds quite harsh but I think all of their belongings would feel like a huge burden to me that I always have to carry around with me. I also don't have any siblings or cousins.

Now the question that I ask myself is: **What should I not throw away?**

Of course I will keep all the important documents like birth certificate, ID, tax docs, pension and insurance docs, death certificate, etc. But what else should I better not throw away?

For example there are over 2,000 family pictures of vacations, birthdays, etc. I have already chosen about 30 pictures that I want to keep. Can I just discard the remaining ones?

Are there any kind of ""situations"" or incidents where I would need something of the estate of my parents or grandparents? The only situation that comes to my mind is something like when the tax authorities want to make sure my parents paid their taxes. Then I would show them my parents' tax documents. Or I have to prove that my parents have died. Then I would show them the death certificate. Are there any other situations where I have to show somebody something from my parents/ grandparents estate?

If you have advice for me personally (own things I shouldn't throw away) I'm very open to hear this as well. Thank you!",declutter,1526146067,MrDeclutter,21,24,True,8ixiql,2018-05-12,"What should I not throw away? Hello redditors, I need your help.

Want to go the Cleansing Fire route (aka massive yard sale followed by goodwill taking everything left) (advice?),"Soo, my community is having a massive massive yard sale this weekend and I want in on it. 

However, I’m still under water in terms of clutter.

I’ve got a couple of big items (super nice desk and a shelf and some vintage hello kitty merch, plus vintage Lisa frank stuff) that I’m going to put price tags on. Everything else is going to be a dollar or fifty cents or free because I ain’t dealing with that. I’m not looking to get a bunch of money, just looking to take advantage of the tons of people to get rid of stuff.

My question becomes should I separate out the few things that I think are actually important  ahead of time and out everything else in a box to go to the yard sale? Or should I take my time with everything? 

If I take my time, I know I’ll be less likely to regret anything. But I’ll also probably end up with keeping more stuff. 

If I limit myself on how much I want to keep, i think it’ll really force me to look at my dragon tendencies and actually only keep a few things, plus I’ll probably go through it all again. But that leaves a bit of space for regrets.

First step either way is to accept that trash is trash is trash and it’s okay to throw trash away.

Virtual decluttering - endless emails,"Hi folks, just discovered this community.

Does anybody have any tips for decluttering email inboxes? Mine are mostly read, but it's just thousands of emails sitting in my inbox that I want to move to folders.

For example - as inane as my grandmother's invitation to Thanksgiving dinner from 2015 is, I want to keep it. It's a nice memory and at some point there won't be any more of those to make. This goes into a Memories folder.

Some of the easier ones to delete without regret are expired coupons/promotions.

The trickier ones: customer service emails. Do I need confirmation of an order being shipped after receiving it? What about somebody I sold something to over kijiji? Etc? These ones are the 'well maybe I'll need it one day' that I'm having a hard time justifying keeping OR throwing away.

Considering getting rid of my childhood diaries,"Hi everyone,

I'm pretty far into my decluttering journey. I don't have much junk at all. One thing I have been hanging onto, tucked into a safe in my closet, are my diaries from when I was 11 to 13. They are so cute to read back on - my first kiss, boyfriend, etc. But they would be mortifying for someone to read after I died. I just bought my first property a few months ago so I'm working on making a will, and my plan is for my best friend to have the safe and destroy the diaries after I die. But if I did die, there would be a whole process of splitting up my estate and I worry that the diaries would fall into the wrong hands given that my best friend is not blood. It's beginning to feel easier to just get rid of them, but I'm not sure if I'm ready. At the same time, it's not like I'm going back and rereading them; I pretty much remember all the cute things in them and that could possibly be enough.

Has anyone gone through a similar situation? Should I just chuck them?

Story and looking for advice on Clothes,"At the moment I'm storing most of my dresses in dresser drawers, rolled up. 

My style and lifestyle allow me to dress very casually almost always. 
In the summer  I mostly wear dresses that are slightly hippy style, made of light material and don't get noticeably wrinkly.

(I just moved almost all of my smarter dresses to Under The Bed storage, and I'm really happy, it's nice not having my mother's voice nag me in my head everytime I pass up wearing one for a more comfortable and casual dress)

I'm trying to get rid of my dresser which
 a) takes up a lot of space
b) looks good on the outside, but cheap and breaking on the inside
c) accumulates junk on the top :( 

By getting rid of about 7 bags full of clothes, using UTB storage and tiding up, I have managed to fit almost all of my clothes in my standing cupboard - the majority is shelf space and lower drawers. I've added hanging shelves because I hate hanging up clothes, and have hung only a few fancier dresses and a single shirt that requires hanging.

The only problem is my dresses. 
I love seeing them all out in front of me to choose from. I don't know where to store them now.

I'm messy but organised - I'm awful at folding, but I like everything having its correct place. I know that if I fold my dresses and fill the shelves up to the top with them (there's about 30 of them) it will be impossible to manage in a couple of weeks.


Advice anyone? 

Everytime I hit a block like this it stops my progress :(

I can now say that my kitchen is (finally) decluttered. I also learned how to get myself to clean in the process.,"This post ended up becoming super long. But if was kind of fun to write.

About two years ago I noticed there were small bugs in my rice. Upon investigating, I found that they had spread into various other stuff, like my musli and some other grain based stuff like flour and oats. Fortunately I think I noticed them before I actually ate any, but they were super hard to get rid of. I had to take out all the food from the cupboards and look through everything. And when I thought I had gotten rid of them, they turned up again because apparently a few always survived. In the end I transferred every kind of food they seemed to like into glass jars, so they couldn't get to the food, which worked out because I haven't seen them in a while.

In the process I realized how much food I have. My kitchen is tiny. It's basically built into one wall of my studio apartment, and there's very little storage space that can be used to store food. Despite this, I had managed to hoard so much food you'd think there's ten people living here. One time I took most of it out and laid it out on the floor, as you can see in [this photo.](https://i.imgur.com/Hg18X7s.jpg) Note that this isn't everything I had, there was more stuff that I didn't feel like taking out. I had also already reduced the amount of stuff by quite a lot at this point. There's so much stuff there that I don't really eat or even like. And because I like to bake and cook, I have a tendency to buy ingredients I'll use once or twice, and then the rest just stays in the cupboard. I also sometimes bought stuff that I felt like I *should* eat, even if I don't like it or know how to prepare it. Case in point: the nori seaweed and so many different kinds of nuts and seeds. 

Because this wasn't especially practical, and because my cupboards were so stuffed I could barely get things out of them, I decided I'd declutter. I turned it into a project to make as much food as possible from the stuff I had. This led to me discovering a few new foods that I really liked, and made me more creative when it comes to cooking. Slowly I got rid of the absolute majority of pantry foods, and I've also managed to avoid hoarding new stuff.

At the same time I got rid of quite a lot of kitchen equipment, and replaced some things with new and much better quality things. Some of the things I threw out are:

- Two cutting boards. One wooden that had gotten warped and one plastic that was really gross. I bought a nice wooden one instead.

- An old frying pan that had multiple scratches in the teflon coating. And since I got a new, super nice high quality pan yesterday, I'm going to get rid of my old scratched up wok pan and the worst pan ever, in which I can even fry plain oil without it sticking. I'll then have three pans in various sizes and three pots in various sizes.

- A pile of old and ugly plates, a bunch of mismatched cups and a bunch of random bowls and stuff. Instead I bought four bowls, four plates and four cups. They are lovely and beautiful and don't take up so much room.

- Various large cooking dishes that I had way too many of in my tiny kitchen.

- My kettle, which had always stood by the stove and had gotten splattered by various stuff which had completely destroyed the outside of it. I replaced it with a beautiful second hand stovetop copper kettle that will probably last the rest of my life.

- Two massive fruit bowls that were both ugly and far from practical. Also, who has two large fruit bowls in a super small apartment?

- Other small stuff that in the end took up quite a lot of room.

I'm now finally at the point where I no longer feel like I'll actively have to think about decluttering. My kitchen is now orderly and manageable. Almost all pantry items are in one small cupboard and one drawer. I keep stuff in labeled jars so no bugs can get to it. And I no longer buy random stuff that I'm not sure I'll actually eat.

During this process I've discovered how to make myself clean more even though I've never really liked cleaning. This might sound simple and silly, but I've actually bought nice cleaning equipment. I kind of dislike plastic, and would like to be as plastic-free as possible, so for example I replaced my plastic dish brush with a wooden, compostable one. (Dish brushes might be a Nordic thing, but if someone doesn't know what it is, it's just a brush you wash dishes with.) I bought steel wool scrubbers to clean my cast iron pans more easily. I also bought two super durable, washable bamboo based cleaning rags, one of which I use in the kitchen and the other is for the rest of the apartment. Those were to replace the gross plasticy rags that always ended up smelly. And perhaps best of all, I bought some super nice smelling cleaning sprays. Seriously. I have one that smells of citrus and thyme for the kitchen and one that smells of lavender and mint for the bathroom. They smell so nice that I want to use them, so I clean stuff much more often. Now if I could just learn to like vacuuming.

So yeah. My kitchen is decluttered. And the rest of my apartment is not far behind. Yay!",declutter,1524861332,PreposterousMoose,56,148,True,8fett3,2018-04-27,"I can now say that my kitchen is (finally) decluttered. I also learned how to get myself to clean in the process.

Partner unable to let go of stuff,"I have been with my partner 10+ years. When I moved in with him we moved in to his childhood home. We have recently bought a house and it will be finished in a few months. 

There is a lot of stuff in our current home. I hate it. I have spent the last year decluttering what little I had and if pushed I could move out on about an hour. 

I always knew he kept a lot of stuff but thought it was laziness rather than not being able to let go. I’ve been panicking about him how much stuff he’s got and how long it will take to go through to decide what he wants to take. 

Today I got him to do most of upstairs. He has about 5 80L storage boxes worth of stuff he wants to take. I anticipate by the time he’s gone through the whole house it will be about 15. I legit had a panic attack thinking about the sheer scale of stuff. 

We don’t have room for it. I don’t want it. I try to talk to him and he either shuts down or gets angry. He literally has 1 full 80L storage box full of old magazines. 

The only thing I have been able to get out of him is that these are his memory’s.

For the first time in 10+ years I sat down and thought I don’t know how to fix this. I can’t take it all with us and I don’t think he will leave without it. I honestly don’t know what to do, any advice?

Amazed at how much we are able to do without!,"Partner and I dropped off three large boxes of kitchenware, a small box of more kitchenware, and two huge trash bags of clothing (~4-5 large boxes), and 2 small pieces of furniture between the two of us.

We have been slowly decluttering and storing things away, either marked for donation or ""just in case"" and it felt so good to see those boxes gone.

We also trashed a lamp, a small couch that we almost never used, some old torn sheets, old guest pillows that we never use, and we filled two boxes of bags to donate or throw out based on their state when we sort through them.

We have two large pieces of furniture that we're giving away and have replaced with things we actually like and use, and one small piece of furniture that we no longer need for storage.

This has completely opened up our storage closet and it's big shelf/ceiling cavity, which I've now been able to repack so that we have easy access to our luggage, camping and outdoors gear, seasonal clothes, and extra kitchen supplies for entertaining.

We cleared out enough to rearrange our furniture, and it feels like we have a brand new living room, and when we finish, we'll have a brand new bedroom.

"To you, what percentage of decluttering is getting rid of stuff versus organizing the stuff you want to keep?","I'm just curious about what you folks think in regards to this, and also to get some conversation going here.

For me, I think of decluttering as 80% getting rid of things that you have and trimming down the number of possessions that you own. The remaining 20% is sensibly and efficiently organizing the possessions that you want to keep, so that they are not taking up unnecessary space.

What questions do you ask yourself before deciding to declutter items?,"So just a quick background story. I am currently living in my first apartment after moving out of my parent's house. I live with my sister and her boyfriend. In the past 5 years I have moved 4 different times and have decluttered a lot with each move. However, in August I am moving into my boyfriend's apartment. His apartment is a lot smaller than mine. We plan to stay there at least a year or two because it's 1) very cheap 2) clean and nice for how cheap it is 3) close to both of our jobs 4) close to both of our friends/family 5) a nice neighborhood overall. The only problem is space is extremely limited. Luckily, he doesn't own much of anything to be honest LOL. I honestly don't own a whole lot of stuff. I have books, a lot less clothes for a typical woman, a small to medium sized makeup collection, and then maybe 3 or 4 tubs of random stuff from my childhood. This spring/summer I plan to go through EVERY. SINGLE. THING. that I own to declutter more and more. I have not yet read Marie Kondo's book, but I know the gist of it. I am just running into a few items that I am not sure what to do with....

1. I have a box of cds. They are all in pretty good condition. Various musicians and bands I loved in high school. Some I don't even listen to much anymore, but for some reason I just can't get rid of. Like Lady Gaga for example. I have all of her cds except her latest release. I loved her music at one point and really cherished these cds. However, I rarely listen to her now, and if I do I just use my iTunes account. Why I can't I let the cds go??

2. Same goes for old Nintendo game cases. I don't play my Nintendo DS much anymore, but enough to want to keep the device, charger, and most of the games. However, I have about 15 games and the cases are the size of cds. When you add them up, that's a lot of space! But something is stopping me from throwing  away the cases (or recycling, whatever). I keep thinking I will regret it for some reason, but I don't know what that reason may be. I am not trying to show off my collection of games, I don't really have a place to store them. I would never get money back if I tried to resell them so there's no point in keeping the cases. Still....can't toss them for some reason.

I am worried that I will end up regretting getting rid of these items. I mentioned moving 4 times in 5 years. Most of the stuff I don't miss, but I carelessly threw away my battered copies of Harry Potter and 2 tubs full of all my high school notes/homework and I regret getting rid of both a lot. I am sentimental about weird stuff I suppose. 

So, I am wondering, what is your process for deciding to declutter an item? Do you have a long series of questions you ask yourself or is it much more simple than that? Any particular advice for me?

Thanks!!

Counterintuitive decluttering tips?,"I've been doing a pretty good job of decluttering. I've freed up a lot of space and made a good amount of money in the process.

That said, even though I feel like I've got the hang of this and decluttering isn't difficult anymore (just time consuming!), I found a suggestion somewhere that seemed counterintuitive to me, but made a big difference in how easy it is to keep somewhere tidy.

The tip was to unstack all my tupperware (that I'd decided to definitely keep after decluttering the Tupperware Cupboard) and put the lids on them, then stack them like that. So now, my tupperware cupboard is fuller than it was when I first decluttered, but it's so much easier to keep tidy.

I just met my neighbor yesterday who is a minimalist,"We were having our garage sale and he rides up on his bike and an interesting shirt that looks like a bolero and shirtless torso otherwise (my husband realized later since he likes to garden it’s probably so his shoulders don’t get burnt.) But he was telling us he has NO furniture. None. Except for a bed to sleep on. And that his goal in life when he dies is to leave nothing behind but his bed and his remains. 

He likes going to people’s garage sales to see the kinds of items other people have. He ended up buying our small toaster because he was making toast on the stove in a cast iron skillet. He figured it was less electricity to use a small toaster than it was to heat up the whole stove/skillet.

Side note: he has a friend who’s a hoarder I thought that was so funny. But it just shows that he’s still a genuine and nice person that didn’t judge others for having so many possessions.

3 pm - Watching some tv, browsing Reddit... still in the mood to clean! I JUST CAN’T F-ING START! **Find Dana White's deslobification theory in this subreddit (Thank you!!)** Download her brand new audio book. Loving it!

4 pm - Hubby texts, want to go to eat Mexican food with our friends? Not really, I want to get started. 

4:30 pm - Mexican sounds good. Hop in the shower.

5:30 - Leave to meet everyone. 

7 pm - Get home, call my mom. She gives me encouragement and says to send her pics. Ok, let’s do this!

7:30 pm - Listening to my audiobook. Cleaned out the litter box in the room I am going to work on. Soaked some paper towels in a very mild bleach water to wipe down things I actually want to keep in that room since they’ve been sitting in the room with the litter box for oh… years?? 

8:30 pm - Thinking I should make a Reddit post. But I don't really know how. Figuring out how to post to Reddit properly. Take pics. Make an imgur account.

I feel kinda ashamed about it as I watch the mess grow back around me, but at the same time I’m not going to let it drag me down, I already hit bottom, the only place left to go is up after all. So while I’m not making large strides like I did the first two days, I’m not letting it get any worse. 

I can now truthfully say I can now fully open my door, walk around half of my room floor, put all of my drawers away in my shelves and tossed out four huge trash bags full of torn clothes, trash, and things I can live without.

"Want to have even less, but don’t know what.","So I’ve been trying to be minimalist since 2012ish, more or less successfully. 

Right now I live in about 12m2 and I still feel like it’s just too much stuff. Part of that is because I move so damn often and I’m sick of dealing with my things. Part of it is I still feel like I could own less, but I don’t know what. 

Every time I go to declutter something, I realise I actually do use it. Stapler? Printer? I’m a lawyer doing a PhD, I kinda need that nonsense / it would be a much bigger hassle to go to a print shop every time. House plants? They’re just about my only hobby.

My clothes on two shelves and a 40cm rail (work is business formal and in climates from arctic to desert so I’ve got more clothes than some might). A shoebox of assorted toiletries and first aid stuff. 

Etc etc. None of it is either markedly lots or markedly little. 

Still, Id love to be like the “Goodbye, Things” fellow or one of those folk who can fit everything they own in a couple of suitcases.

Consumption Tracker - Android app for tracking consumption,"Hi,

I've created an Android app for tracking consumption of things you purchase such as grocery items, etc.

Basically, for each item, you enter name, purchase date, quantity, and cost and other details and later you mark the item as used when it's completely used.

You can monitor your consumption and view stats and charts about your expenses.

Features:

* Add as many items as you want.
* Capture and add photos of items.
* Manage and assign categories to items.
* View stats and charts about expenses in a given date range.
* Export data to CSV file.
* Create and restore local data backup copy.
* Here's the link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.consumptiontracker

Tips on being a more organized/cleaner person,"Hi all! 

So i’m a 24 yo male, and I just want to be more organize and cleaner in general. I’m not gross or dirty, but my room does stay pretty messy.

Sentimental Item Help,"Like many people inspired by Marie Kondo, my husband and I have decided to do a spring cleaning/declutter/organization.

"Looking to create a basic but detailed daily schedule for myself.

I am currently out of work as I try to work through a recent traumatic experience, and right now it is very easy to find excuses just spend the whole day in bed. I thrive on structure, and honestly don’t do well without it. I am essentially trying to get my ass in gear right now the only way I really know how - by keeping myself busy, and filling my schedule with positive and/or productive activities. But without a structure to fall back on, I’m kind of flailing. I need, at least for right now while I am a total mess, to literally plan out each day and force myself to stick to that plan. I need to be somewhat strict and detailed about it right now so there is little room to fall apart. I plan to allow time for rest and relaxing activities as well, but I am seeing that need to schedule that time, or else it turns into an entire day spent in bed.

What I’m basically looking for is a modality for organizing each day - what time I will wake up, my activities down to the hour, and my meals, as I have been eating like garbage lately and feeling horrible about it.

I’m curious what you all would suggest. My initial thought was a journal or planner or some sort because I like the idea of using a tangible object, but I am VERY anal and I could honestly see myself getting hung up on “how do I format this?” and just giving up (which I know probably sounds silly but that is a very real struggle for me, lol). If you suggest a journal or planner, are there ones that come “pre-formatted,” where I would just fill in my planned hourly activities? If not, how would you personally go about creating a formatting that is clean and organized? Would you maybe draw grids that break up the day, or would you just write “10-11am: gym” or whatever, in list form?

Or perhaps there are apps that would work just as well for this kind of fairly basic scheduling. I am not necessarily against using an app, and I would definitely be willing to look into any that are recommended to me. Maybe even some kind of computer program (something like MS Excel?) could be suited to this. I don’t really know.

"Recommend actions for a ""Day of Organizing""","Hey everyone! 

So in terms of physical organization I am fairly decent (not much clutter, things organized in groups of items with similiar functions); however , in regard to more abstract organization (*PRIORITIZATION and TRACKING of tasks, emails, computer files, basically anything more abstract than physical organization of tangible items) I struggle quite a bit more.

I wanted to get a spice rack and matching jars to put them in with custom labels. Do I buy a jar for every type of spice I EVER use, even when 90% of the time I never use it.

Preparing pantries for purposeful pursuits?,"

**The set up**
I have two pantry closets i have struggled to organize for 4 years now. They are both aprox. 3'w X2'd and each are 8' tall.

 One is for food and has four DEEP shelves every 18""or so and one shallow shelf at the top i cant really utilize.

The catch all pantry has two deep shelves at 6' and 7' 6"". That one stored my trashcan and critter food for a long time. I recently relocated the trash can.

The biggest issue with my house is dead space. My kitchen cabinets have massive amounts of dead space. My closets have dead space, my rooms, well you get the point. Ive decided to address them one at a time starting with my catch all pantries. So here we go with the questions.  

**The needs**
 The easy one... My food pantry shelves are fairly organized i have a 12pk soda cardboard container for can, and the boxes ramen comes in to separate goods by type but yhe back of the door is not utilized space and i would like to be able to store spices and jars there. 

The catch all pantry... idk id like some kind of stackable storage thing for my critter food, id like to be able to store my mop bucket in there and id like to keep broom and dustpan in there. But i also need more shelf space so the broom and dust pan also need to be hung on the door?  I have the wall space to put hooks in the walls but that doesn't solve my broom/mop storage issue. I have hardwood so i never have a dripping mop and i could hang it to store it.  Ive got some bulk cleaner in there, garden gloves, SOME utility tools so I dont have to go downstairs to the garage for just a screwdriver. That kind of thing. Its just underutilized space.

**the questions**

Does anyone have a recommendation for an over/on the door rack that will store spices and jars comfortably? 

Does anyone have advice for storing dry goods on a deep shelf that keeps things accesable? 

The catch all pantry... idfk. I gotta store my critter food better than just bags on the floor but after that... I got nothing.  All ideas are welcome.

Help organizing baby clothes please!,"I posted on r/declutter already but figured here might have some handy advice as well, if that's alright. Thanks!!

I bought [this canvas wardrobe](https://imgur.com/a/wdPKzqa) , 6 storage boxes, and small chest if drawers and a plastuc 4 tub storage unit to store all my babies clothes but don't know how to get started and am overwhelmed by the amount, any help please??

It has 2 hanging racks, 6 cubes in which I have placed boxes and at the bottom of the hanging racks, a flat space which looks useful for blankets and sheets?

My child is in 3 sizes of clothes currently due to me using reusable diapers which cause a very large butt and need bigger sizes and also using disposables which need the smaller sizes. I'm not sure how to sort them due to the variety of clothes as well - sleepsuits, bodysuits, baby grows, pants/trousers, t shirts, hoodies, coats, pram suits etc. If I sort via size then the categories mix, but if I sort by category then it's harder to find the right size depending on what diaper he has. I don't have much hanging space so most will be in the boxes so how would I sort by size if each box is a different type of clothing? I could learn each piece but that's a large feat. I would prefer to have his sleepsuits/all in ones hung as he uses them most but not sure if it makes more sense to hang other things?

Currently all but his normal current size with the small diapers are stored in plastic boxes under my bed but I need them easily accessible now. 

All his soft toys, misc soft things and muslins/clothes and mittens are currently in a canvas shoe holder on the back of his door which is great. His socks, bibs and hats are in those drawer organisers in his very small 3 drawer chest of drawers with towels and baby sleeping bags on the bottom, pram suits/fluffies on the second and drawer organiser on the top. I also have an above waist high 4 drawer plastic storage unit which I can use but it currently empty.

If anyone can offer any suggestions I will be amazingly grateful as I'm not naturally this organised but I do enjoy my house tidy with everything in it's place and the baby clothes have defeated me with the sheer number of his clothes (especially as they were all given to me so I don't know all the clothes and didn't choose them so I can't just look at them and know the size or fit etc).

Organizing supplies at work,"Hey organized people. I need some suggestions on what i could do to organize supplies at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the easiest explanation for what we do would be a small events coordination type of atmosphere. So we have stuff for food/catering...bowls, cups, snacks, coffee pods, teas - health/hygiene stuff ...sunscreens, hand sanitizer, first aid, aspirin type things - garbage bags, towels, office supplies, phone chargers....a million more small things. Right now everything is in plastic storage tote boxes but people are talking about moving it to some kind of storage where they can easily just grab 1 or 2 of things not the WHOLE BOX. We probably only have like max 10 of each thing (excluding disposable stuff like plastic cups where there would be a lot more). Like 10 candles, or 10 rolls of paper tape, or 10 wooden bowls, or 10 tablecloths. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're also really really hard on wear and tear so whatever solution we find needs to be extra sturdy. I'm thinking either commercial products or garage storage type of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of struggling to find a good solution that's somewhat cost effective (no super custom stuff), closed (no dust), and where there would be availability to have different sized drawers or shelves or cubbies etc since everything is vastly different sizes. But i'm also seeing a lot of multi drawer options that are too small and shelves that are too large! Something with stackable options for different size compartments would be good too. Bonus points for furniture with wheels.

Why did you choose to use this system? Where did you learn it from/How did you come up with it?

What about your current organization system is bothersome? Does it ever fail completely?

Can you describe to me an organization system in an ideal world? Be as creative as you want to be, ignore tech constraints. → What do you want but can’t have?

When do problems typically arise? What causes them?

Can you tell me how people typically use the space?

\ The Life Changing Magic of Tidying up | Quick Insights /,"  

My apartment used to be a Mess!.. :(  

Full of things I never used and that didn't make me Happy!

So I used the Konmari method, that I learned from the Book: ""The life changing magic of tidying up"" by Marie Kondó.

**Here's my summary of the book**:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxyec4q3K-M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxyec4q3K-M)

in the book ""The life changing magic of tidying up"", Mare Kondó says:

*""If you use the right method and concentrate your efforts on eliminating clutter thoroughly and completely within a short span of time, you’ll see instant results that will empower you to keep your space in order ever after""*

Now let's get straigt to the method:

**Step 1: Question why you want to tidy.**

Step one is to question why you want to tidy, and then question the answer you give and then question the next answer and so on, until you arrive at the underlying reason, which is that you want to be happy. This will then fire up your motivation to begin tidying.

**Step 2: Discard everything that doesn't bring you joy:**

Step two is to discard everything that doesn't bring you joy, and it's important that you do this before organizing.

Start early in the morning, so your mind is sharp and tidy one category of things at a time, since this will make it easier to compare items, and thereby see what you should throw out.

Start with the category of items, where it is easiest for you to decide if you should throw stuff out, so you can improve your decision making skills until you get to the harder stuff.

Marie Kondó recommends tidying different categories in this order:  clothing, books, papers, miscellaneous, mementos.

And to determine if you should throw something out or keep it you should ask yourself: ""Does this item bring me joy?"" And do this with all items until your are done and ready for the next step:

**Step 3: Organize the remaining stuff:**

Step three is to organize the remaining stuff.

Mare Kondó recommends the following 2 tips for organizing your things:

1 Sort everything by category, so you know exactly where everything belongs.

2 Place things you use often where you can easily access them.

That's all there is to it  :) You can watch the video presentation of this here:

Ideas for storing or displaying a collection of pin-back buttons?,"Please let me know if this is the wrong sub or if there is a better one to post in. 

I have a collection of pin-back buttons of various sizes and shapes from over the years. I was attaching most of them to my backpack, but then they started falling off and getting lost. (Yesterday I noticed I lost one from a vintage store I visited in Vienna and almost cried.)

So right now I have them just sitting in a pile on my desk. 

My room is quite small and I don’t really have any available drawers or shelves, but I’d like to display them somehow if anyone has a creative idea. 

I’d say I have probably 30-40 buttons, enough to fill a Tupperware container.

Some Nicely Organized Deep Drawers,"Having just done laundry a couple of days ago, I thought I'd share my chest of drawers.

My biggest tip for keepsakes and memorabilia as a professional,"Keep a memory box or hope-chest if you are particularly sentimental! If it takes up more then just wall space put it in one!

Use little boxes for small things, pins, necklaces, etc 

Photo albums are a must

Possibly laminate papers and place them in labeled folders.  “Notes from friends” “2010 art” etc

Label by year, event, specific people or places

You can store a small box literally anywhere but I recommend a closet or somewhere frequently used. Don’t want to forget it’s even there. Putting it in a high space that isn’t as easy to reach would help keep easily accessible places open for more frequently used things. A large chest could go at the foot of a bed! 

I highly recommend this for many reasons. My favorite use for one is taking some “self care” time to sit back and relive some wonderful memories.

[For writers] How do you keep track of multiple drafts?,"Hi, so I'm writing my personal statement for medical school right now, and really struggling with the 20 or so drafts that I have that are all kinda similar but not-insignificantly different (if that makes any sense?). They all have similar themes, but there are differences in tone, narrative style, and focus on certain anecdotes among them all. I'm kinda losing my mind over these because I save ALL my drafts and I'm not sure how to intergrate them all, because they've all branched out so radically from one another but some of the older ones have things I like and GAH I'm gonna be working on this for 4 more months so really lost @ what is going to happen at the end of it all.

organizing notes,"I am somewhat familiar with GTD and have previously made use of tools such as todoist (but now prefer paper lists for regular review), however, I'm somewhat lost when it comes to keeping my notes organized.  every day I accumulate snippets of information that I need around but only some of that information are tied directly to tasks in the near future.

My organization system,"Hey guys I started this as a response to the ""I need help remembering where I organized things!!"" thread but then it grew and grew until it should probably be its own post.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share with you all my system for organizing things. These are techniques I have developed over the course of a lifetime as an organizer. I live in a small apartment and so it's vital for me to organize and pack everything away as soon as I'm done using it, which led me to develop this system:

&amp;#x200B;

Get some shelves and some stackable plastic boxes. Maybe go to IKEA. IKEA is great because you can determine the dimensions of everything beforehand and make sure everything fits together seamlessly.

&amp;#x200B;

Start a gdoc, or perhaps a google sheet if you're so inclined. This is your ""finding aid."" Each box is dedicated to different types of thing. Label each box in alphanumeric order, e.g. ""A, B, C,"" and so on and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Sub-boxes are assigned a number. So for instance my box A is a hanging file with folders ""A1, A2, A3, etc.""

&amp;#x200B;

The secret to this is that you should only label things with the ""accession number"" so that you only catalog each item once, in your gdoc. What I mean by this is that you shouldn't have to ever change the label if you move something from box A to box B, you should only have to change the gdoc. This will make your life a lot easier later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The gdoc needs to be formatted in a hierarchical and chronological order. For instance, ""A1"" and ""A2"" sub-boxes should be recorded in your gdoc under the heading ""A.""

&amp;#x200B;

Just let them accumulate, and always make sure you're adding at the bottom of the section. This will ensure that everything is logged in chrono order.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever you add something to a box or sub-box, make sure you add a timestamp, along with a brief description of the item. Write your description in a way to ensure that it is searchable later on. Try to normalize your vocabulary by using consistent terms when describing things. This will help you when you need to search the gdoc later on.

&amp;#x200B;

The best part about using gdocs is that as you walk amongst your shelves, searching for what you need, you can pull up the doc on your phone and search it to recall where you put things.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're technically minded, you can even label the boxes with QR codes that link back to the appropriate section of your gdoc so that you can immediately figure out what's in a box without having to rustle through and disturb all of its contents.

&amp;#x200B;

But where do you put things that have not been cataloged!? Well, I have a system for that, too. You can't be so rigid. There's some stuff that you just need floating around ""on hand"" on your desk all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

For papers which are not cataloged yet, you should need a wire mesh organizer with no more than three baskets.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first, you store actionable items (e.g. bills, applications, pending  taxes, crap that you're working on this week.)

&amp;#x200B;

In the second, you store items that you don't want to lose, that are going into your archive. (tax records, pay stubs, large receipts, warranties, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

The third basket is full of papers that have been processed that you don't want to keep. Bank statements, junk mail, pre-approved credit card offers, scraps of paper, etc. You need to empty this drawer once per week and run all of this stuff through a high-quality crosscut shredder. Shred ALL papers you throw away, not just sensitive documents. This ensures that sensitive info that you want to forget is well and truly forgotten, while other things you want to remember are remembered forever.

&amp;#x200B;

By this point, you will still have a bunch of office supplies and miscellaneous crap on your desk. A pen cup and a desk with drawers go a long way towards wrangling all that stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I would caution you against is accumulating a lot of crap in your desk drawers (or anywhere, really) that you don't use. Do not allow this stuff to accumulate. First of all, stop buying it in the first place. If you already bought it, ask yourself ""is this something I will ever really use?"" If it has emotional attachment to you, it should go in your archive in a box dedicated to memorabilia, otherwise, chuck it out.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're like me and you have a hard time throwing things out, you can give them away to people, or put them outside with a sign indicating that they are free.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to fight the hoarding instinct. If it's something no one wants, you have to force yourself to throw it away. Once you throw away the first, it gets easier, and you can keep going and throw out everything else that needs to go, all in one batch.

&amp;#x200B;

My last and final bit of advice to you is to refrain from accumulating miscellaneous piles of stuff. You need to identify and attack these early on, maybe on a weekly basis. The secret is to re-organize yourself on a tight loop so that it keeps the amount of work small, something you can do in about a half hour. This will prevent you from procrastinating later on.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you use this system, or if you see any room for improvement. I just hope that the lessons I've learned can be a benefit to some of you out there who are struggling with organization.",organization,1548341861,Dismal-Justin,1,1,True,ajd798,2019-01-24,"My organization system Hey guys I started this as a response to the ""I need help remembering where I organized things!!"" thread but then it grew and grew until it should probably be its own post.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share with you all my system for organizing things. These are techniques I have developed over the course of a lifetime as an organizer. I live in a small apartment and so it's vital for me to organize and pack everything away as soon as I'm done using it, which led me to develop this system:

&amp;#x200B;

Get some shelves and some stackable plastic boxes. Maybe go to IKEA. IKEA is great because you can determine the dimensions of everything beforehand and make sure everything fits together seamlessly.

&amp;#x200B;

Start a gdoc, or perhaps a google sheet if you're so inclined. This is your ""finding aid."" Each box is dedicated to different types of thing. Label each box in alphanumeric order, e.g. ""A, B, C,"" and so on and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Sub-boxes are assigned a number. So for instance my box A is a hanging file with folders ""A1, A2, A3, etc.""

&amp;#x200B;

The secret to this is that you should only label things with the ""accession number"" so that you only catalog each item once, in your gdoc. What I mean by this is that you shouldn't have to ever change the label if you move something from box A to box B, you should only have to change the gdoc. This will make your life a lot easier later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The gdoc needs to be formatted in a hierarchical and chronological order. For instance, ""A1"" and ""A2"" sub-boxes should be recorded in your gdoc under the heading ""A.""

&amp;#x200B;

Just let them accumulate, and always make sure you're adding at the bottom of the section. This will ensure that everything is logged in chrono order.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever you add something to a box or sub-box, make sure you add a timestamp, along with a brief description of the item. Write your description in a way to ensure that it is searchable later on. Try to normalize your vocabulary by using consistent terms when describing things. This will help you when you need to search the gdoc later on.

&amp;#x200B;

The best part about using gdocs is that as you walk amongst your shelves, searching for what you need, you can pull up the doc on your phone and search it to recall where you put things.

&amp;#x200B;

"Deep bathroom drawer, what to do?","Hi!! I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out a way to organize the drawer under the sink of our bathroom.
Some idiot designer thought that it would be a good idea to put a 50cm (!) deep (as in height) drawer in the cabinet under the sink in the bathroom in our apartment instead of doors and shelves. I am pretty sure it’s meant for a kitchen or something, to store pots. But alas, it is in my bathroom and it’s such a nightmare.

It’s by far the most disorganized part of the house and because  I use it daily one of the biggest mess-related anxiety generators for me. I’ve tried putting boxes and piling them up, but that is really not practical at all, which in reality means I have basically the whole cabinet as wanted space, and a cluttered counter where all the things that should go under the sink end up.

I thought about just taking the drawer out and putting doors myself, but the apartment is a rental, so even if I were allowed to do it (which I think I’m not), I still would have to keep a 50x50x100cm drawer stored somewhere in the apartment as I can’t throw it away, and there is simply no space for that.

Closet organization tips?,"My husband and I have a closet that's basically a double closet(2 sets of 2 doors) with our dresser on one side and clothes hanging on the other side.

Help Organzing a long closet with hard to reach space?,"I am a renter in a duplex. The duplex was built in 1971 and has one of those long wall closets in the bedroom.

Threshold cube shelves question,"I bought a 2x3 threshold cube system (13”) from Target a couple years ago, and the cloth drawers to go in it.
I keep a variety of things in the drawers, one of which is workout pants/tops. I used to roll them, and stand them on end, but find that pulling a few out, eventually leads to them toppling over, and the visibility of which pair of black yoga pants/black workout top I am grabbing is minimal. I just don’t like that system. I would much rather do a more shallow fold, like I do on the clothes in my drawers (something similar to a konmari fold).
I know when I bought the system originally, they had a shelves you could get to split the 13” cubes in half or even in quarters, but it appears they no longer manufacture them. I have considered making my own, but the finish won’t match, which will likely drive me crazy.
It’s a great piece and I hate to get rid of it. Any ideas for either making these deep deep cubes work or better yet where I can get the threshold 13” shelves?

Toy storage using fabric cubes-advice requested,"For a few years, we have been using a toy sorter similar to the Honey Can Do Kids Toy Storage and Organizer. I can't seem to post a picture, but it is a  system of three tilted shelves and about 10 plastic bins. I like this product because it helps us organize by category (animal figures, dolls, Play Doh, etc) and keeps toys visible for my five-year-old.

I have recently found a picture of a playroom that uses cubby shelving and 13 inch fabric cubes. I am considering replacing our current system because using these cubes looks much tidier. I already have three of these cubes that I could use for toy storage. 

I am looking for tips from parents who already use these cubes to organize toys. Because these cubes are so tall, I suspect that they work best with larger toys.  What are the pros and cons in your opinion?

Organizing but also have OCD,"So, I am going through all my boxes from moving. With large amounts of similar items it is very easy, I can fill a box pretty easily and label it.

I am about halfway through all my items, but now I am left with more difficult items. If I wanted a box to be specifically categorized, the box would only be 2/5 full and I would have way to many partially filled boxes.

The OCD part comes into play because I hate generic mix matches boxes. Which has left me to purchasing Sterilite steel totes in the 10/18/30 gal sizes. They are affordable as far as getting a bundle. I can get 8, 18 gal. Totes in Walmart for $45. The other things I use to store items is cardboard filing boxes.

Essentially, have weird items I have to store now.  Like a record player, doesn’t really fit in any of these boxes. And if I put in a huge box can’t really lay items on top of it, or store it with other like items.

The other issue is the cost of organizing with OCD. I am sure I could do it a lot cheaper with generic totes I buy on sale.  It to mention I wanted to use the vertical space in the room I store my items, in which the only shelving unit I found that would work for the totes was $230.

Here is our pantry cupboard:

Both top and bottom are  2 ft deep and around 28 inches side (a little more narrow at the door, thanks to a lip).

The top two shelves on the top portion are just boards that sit on supports on the sides -- complete removable.  Same for the stop shelf on the bottom. It's so big and deep that things get lost. We've tried plastic containers to a certain extent but that didn't keep us organized. You can't see it in the picture, but I did put in a wire shelf on wheels on the bottom-most part for the food processor and another small appliance.

Professional but active solutions for carrying things,"I work at a high paced job and I am constantly needing things and having to back track to where things are stored and/or carrying them becomes cumbersome.

It is not feasible to carry a purse/bag around, nor would it be professional. I am a girl, so things have been falling out of the useless female pockets. 

I don't need much ... But it would be super helpful if I had (in order of priority)
My phone (large style, but I need to know when my boss contacts me on it as well as appreciating multiple trackers I have on there)
A notebook (small is fine, but too small loses usefulness)
A pen (easy, but part of the list)
A tape measure (not critical, but it is one of the most common needed item I have to scrounge for)
A box cutter (maybe pocket knife would work, doesn't have to be huge)

My current thoughts:
Belt pouch - I think I can get this looking professional but I am not a huge fan so looking for alternatives.

I don't need much ... But it would be super helpful if I had (in order of priority)
My phone (large style, but I need to know when my boss contacts me on it as well as appreciating multiple trackers I have on there)
A notebook (small is fine, but too small loses usefulness)
A pen (easy, but part of the list)
A tape measure (not critical, but it is one of the most common needed item I have to scrounge for)
A box cutter (maybe pocket knife would work, doesn't have to be huge)

Belt pouch - I think I can get this looking professional but I am not a huge fan so looking for alternatives.

"Unable to hang things on the wall, how do I organize my apartment?","Hey r/organization, I'm so glad you're here, because frankly, I'm at my wit's end.

I'm no stranger to methods like Konmari.  I grew up with a mom who was a bit of a horder (still is) and because of that I don't have much trouble getting rid of things anymore, or seeking out ways to keep my life decluttered.

My issue at this point is trying to figure out ways to organize my stuff.  For the next two years or more, my boyfriend and I will be staying in our one-bedroom apartment.  We really like where we are, but space is limited.  This wouldn't be much of an issue normally, but we're under strict orders not to hang *anything* from the walls as our landlord doesn't want holes in the wall.  We get around some of that simply by using the command strips, but they only can hold so much weight.  So while it's fine for items like corkboard or light-weight decoration, it's not helpful for things like shelving, which I could get so much use out of storage-wise.

Honestly, I'm just completely lost on how to organize my stuff at this point.  Everything ends up piled on my shelves because there's only so many placed to put things.  On top of that, we have a very mouthy, very large puppy who likes to get into stuff.

I'm looking for ideas to organizations that don't include any shelving/storage that would need to be hung up, and hopefully a method or way of doing this without the floor being cluttered up.

Organize your Schedule in a Mobile App!,"Hi Fellow Redditors,

MeetPoint is the solution that I came up with to address problems with conventional apps such as Apple Calendar, Wunderlist (to-do list) and Google Calendar. As a habitual planner, I used all three apps to plan out my schedule in advance. Still, I found that oftentimes my friends would ask me if I was free certain times in the day or if I was going to a party / professional event, valid questions since they don't have access to my schedules in those apps.

I thought to myself, wouldn't it be much easier to be able to see my friends' schedules, and if they could see mine, so we wouldn't get wrapped up asking each other all the time. In addition, if we were going to a party together or gym together we could decide on a specific meeting place &amp; time &amp; share that event on our schedules.

Eight brutal months of iOS development later (I was a complete novice coming into it, constantly scouring / begging for answers on StackOverflow), I released MeetPoint on iOS to some success -- while not immensely popular like I hoped, I learned a lot about my users (i.e. many hate Facebook login, rightfully so -- I added a Google login option) and that many Redditors were in fact Android users.

To promote a truly universal social application (iOS + Android. = 99% of mobile users) for scheduling, as per my dream, I got to work on an Android application last month and will finish by the end of this month, which I will announce on my product hunt page below.

Simply hold down anywhere on the map &amp; it'll create an event with a specific location &amp; start time / end time, and click on your friends' profile pictures to view their schedules. I designed the app to be as easy to use as possible (and aesthetic as possible).

I hope you'll subscribe / try the iOS version, it's free &amp; ad-free!

Right now I have my microwave sitting on the counter and my collection of dishes and glasses sitting in the cubby hole that was meant for the microwave. Both the pressure cooker and the slow cooker have very short cords so I need to move the microwave back into the cubby hole where the dishes sit so everything can be plugged in.

My problem is I'm afraid to keep my dishes sitting on the counter in case they get knocked off. I can't put them in any cupboards since they are all too high for me to reach. Is there any idea of what I can do with my dishes so they are contained and safe on the counter? I have 6 dinner plates, 6 dessert plates, 6 bowls, 21 glasses (I know I have a lot of them, they make me happy so I can't get rid of any), and 2 wine glasses to deal with.

Does anyone else notice that older folk in their life do a lot of “leisure shopping”?,"I understand that leisure shopping is common in most age demographics, but I certainly notice it a lot more in my grandparents and their siblings. I’m not even sure if this is the right place to post this, but I feel like this community would understand and have some valuable discussion.

I noticed my grandma’s “hobby” is to buy clothes and random things from the thrift store/department stores. She’s constantly buying clothes, but I’ve never seen her purge anything from her closet. After years of doing this, I’m pretty sure her closet isn’t even functional anymore. I know a lot of spaces in her house aren’t as functional as they could be because of Knick knacks (kitchen counters, bathroom counters).

I realize older folk may have a harder time maintaining the hobbies they used to have, so an easy, default hobby would be shopping. 

I also notice that the older folk in my life tend to justify an item’s “value”. Because it’s an antique, it absolutely has a price value. Meanwhile, I know the truth is that just because it is an antique, doesn’t mean it is worth more money. 

This became a lot longer than I anticipated. Feel free to chime in with your thoughts.

"How should I store a marble pastry board (26 pounds, 24"" by 16"")? Is there a bag that is large and durable enough for it?","Hello. Over the last few weeks, I have done countless searches on Reddit, Google, and home organization websites, and I haven't found an answer. Heck, this seems unique enough that I haven't even seen anyone ask it.

I purchased a marble pastry board, which is basically just a heavy slab of marble from Crate &amp; Barrel ([product link](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/french-kitchen-marble-pastry-slab/s285048)). At 26 pounds in weight and 24"" by 16"" in dimensions, it's pretty heavy and huge.

**I am seeking a way to store the pastry board that looks decent in my modern kitchen.**

I usually store my cutting boards in a cabinet that has a pull-out drawer, but this is both too heavy and large for the drawer. I only use it maybe once a month to roll dough, so I kind of want it out of the way.

My two possible half-solutions are:

1. Leave it on my counter-top. If I do that, I want something to cover it so it doesn't get dusty and so I can leave other kitchen items on it.
2. Store it upright between a wall and a cabinet. (Imagine the small space between a refrigerator and a wall that I'd slide it into.) If I do that, I want a bag to store it in so it doesn't get dusty. The only thing I can think of is an [art canvas bag](https://www.amazon.com/MUSEUM-PORTFOLIO-18-Inch-24-Inch-Black/dp/B007NG55ZO). However, I am nervous that those bags aren't meant to hold an item that is 26 pounds, so sliding it in and out of the small space may tear the bottom of the bag.

Note-taking app focused on the content organization - Unit Notes,"Hey there.

Just want to take a few minutes of your time and introduce the new note-taking app my team and I worked for a long time.

We've decided to create it because we didn't find any effective solution for collecting and organizing a big number of notes (yes, I have a lot of them).

So, [Unit](https://unit.ms/) is a note-taking app that provides a quite new experience of collecting, organizing and managing all your notes.

Content in Unit is made up of independent blocks, like texts, lists, tasks, images, files etc., so a user has the ability to manage the data more efficiently.

There's a lot of interesting features like content reordering by gestures, the ability to create nested hierarchy, tags, reminders, color coding, offline mode, telegram messenger integration etc.

Currently, we have an only iOS app but planning to release new popular platforms in the nearest future.

We're actively looking for feedback. Please let me know what do you think.

Thanks.

Just want to take a few minutes of your time and introduce the new note-taking app my team and I worked for a long time.

We've decided to create it because we didn't find any effective solution for collecting and organizing a big number of notes (yes, I have a lot of them).

So, [Unit](https://unit.ms/) is a note-taking app that provides a quite new experience of collecting, organizing and managing all your notes.

Content in Unit is made up of independent blocks, like texts, lists, tasks, images, files etc., so a user has the ability to manage the data more efficiently.

There's a lot of interesting features like content reordering by gestures, the ability to create nested hierarchy, tags, reminders, color coding, offline mode, telegram messenger integration etc.

Currently, we have an only iOS app but planning to release new popular platforms in the nearest future.

We're actively looking for feedback. Please let me know what do you think.

Thanks.

How to become more organized person in general,"Hello Reddit!

I am a mom of 2 young kids who works a demanding sales job and I’m constantly a disorganized mess. I just recently began using a paper calendar for all commitments and dates for the children and work but want to expand my organizational skill set at home. 

I am chronically disorganized. From not putting things in the same place, to not knowing when the kids have a day off, to struggling to find a pair of shoes which match. How can I refrain my brain to become organized so I can execute on more goals? I feel like a dreamer who never follows through on great ideas.

Any courses or books to recommend? How do I even begin? 

This may be wicked vague and too generic for advice but I’ve reached a point where I’m tired of the stress created by living my life in chaos.

Looking for an organization solution,"At work we use a lot of large format films. 13"" x19"" Like a clear transparency films.

"How do you store clothes that have been worn, but aren’t quite dirty? Trying to avoid the dreaded Clothes Chair","I have a horrible habit of leaving clothes lying around. Specifically, I will stack the clothes on a chair or a desk. If things get bad enough, I stack them on the floor. This usually happens after two things

2) Garments I’ve worn for a day/ an outing. If I was to do laundry, I might wash these clothes. But if I put off laundry, I could get away with wearing them again. These also get thrown onto the clothes chair (or my desk, or the floor)

Organizing Computer components/cables,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I work as an IT Manager at a small business.  One of the problems I'm running into is I have computer accessories EVERYWHERE.  I have right now like 4-5 large boxes in my office packed with keyboards, mice, speakers, power cables, vga cables, ethernet cables, etc.

I have the cables taped up so they aren't just getting all tangled, but I want a way to organize all of this stuff neatly and out of sight.  Any good tips on some sort of organizational boxes I can use?  A lot of the ones I look at our suited more for smaller things like loose screws, paperclips, etc.  All this stuff is a bit larger and requires more space.

He used part of the basement as his wood shop and stored his tools in this area and some of them in his van for easier travel. Since then he hasn’t had much use for his tools and so the basement became an area where we would throw stuff that we either didn’t know what to do with, or didn’t have space elsewhere for it. 

10 years later, it’s just very inefficient and I’m working on other parts of the house that needs work, some of which have items that belong in the basement. So I feel like making the basement more organized will help with organizing the rest of the house. 

I started doing some cleaning on a whim, so my dad doesn’t know yet that I’ve started working on it. None of the stuff belongs to me, so obviously I can’t just get rid of stuff without his permission, but I’ll be sure to have him help with that part. 

I’ll put some pictures in the comments, but basically, it’s extremely overwhelming and I’m not entirely sure where to start. I plan on getting some shelves and jars for small parts, but is there anything else that would be useful?

Help me organise my life please!,"Hello everyone!  


First time posting on this subreddit so bear with me.  


Here's my backstory: I'm a freshly graduated medicine doctor, about to start working in say... a week or so. Medicine never interested me THAT much. I mean, I had a certain interest in it when i finished high school, didn't know which faculty to attend, so I chose med school. I'm not discontented for going to med school. I learned some valuable life lessons and I would probably do it the same all over again. 

Back when I was a kid,  I used to draw a lot. For a kid, I did pretty good in my opinion. Videogames also had a high impact in my life. I was in front of my PC all the time, playing Warcraft, Baldurs gate... well, all kinds of games, actually. I often drew my own little stories and comics, creating all sorts of characters and their backstories and imagined making my own game one day,. I even made some pen and paper/board games back in the day! I also learned how to play the guitar, and was in a band briefly. Never learned to play it as I really wanted, but more about that later. 

Around my 3rd-4th year of med school, my artsy nature revealed itself again. I started dabbling around in digital art, also started learning some 3d modeling and animation, which really piqued my interest, started learning some game development stuff like game engines... I was all over the place. Every little thing regarding gamedev, from writing the scenario, doing the soundtrack to concept art and game models was interesting and fun to me, and I could see myself doing it for a living. I remember my gf often thought it was a phase, and I'd get over it after the semester passes, but my interest only rose, to the point where I want to do art and/or videogame development for a living. 

When I passed my last exam in July, I made a promise to myself to use the summer holidays to really do something useful. I started jogging every morning, started lifting weights (cause on top of it all, I also want to look good xD), drawing every day along some drawing books, did digital sculpting exercises in blender3D every day... and it went pretty good for awhile. Soon, my dissertation stuff came and I was busy with it, but I still jogged at least. Then, I graduated and came home for good. In the meantime I also obtained another instrument, an accordion, and have decided to learn how to play it along with perfecting my guitar skills on top of already drawing and 3Dmodeling every day. Also, I decided to start the Insanity fitness program instead of jogging, to burn some of that extra belly fat.

This is where things started to get a bit messy. I divided my day, and decided to do, each day, a drawing or two, a digital sculpt, play the guitar for at least an hour and learn to play the accordion. I also had my Insanity sessions in the late afternoon, and I wanted to maintain some sort of a social life. Besides that, I also wanted some free time to play videogames, since they bring me joy and relaxation. Unfortunately, I burned out and couldn't find the willpower to do it all in one day. I did one or two things tops (along Insanity, I never missed that). After a long chat with my girlfriend she advised me to pick something and just practice that ONE thing till I become really, really good, and then move on to the other one. I enrolled in a CGMA course for Art foundations (40 weeks) and am now drawing every day and doing Insanity. Although, my accordion and guitar (which I sometimes play, just usual things that I know) are still here, and I gotta say, I miss playing them, and I miss blender3D. I'm thinking of maybe trying to incorporate it again into my schedule.

Until now, I had all the time in the world for everything I wanted to do, and it was awesome. These holidays were among the best times of my life. I had a blast, really. But now, I'm soon going to work every day for 8 hours straight. My girlfriend is still on college and we're long distance at the moment, and will be for the next 2 years (with seeing each other on every other weekend etc. That's the one thing I don't worry about, I just know it will work :) ). I want to USE that time efficiently, and brush my skills cause frankly, I don't intend to be a doctor my whole life. My plan was to do my internship, pick a specialization, finish its 5 years and then work the next 5 years as a specialist (so 10 years basically) which I have to, since it's part of the contract and then, if I can financially support myself from my freelance art business/gamedev work I would like to quit my job and pursue a career in game development. If not, I can live a happy life as a doctor as well. But I need to know that I tried at least.  


If you made it till here, firstly, thanks a lot for the read :)

So, what I want is to make some sort of a plan for my life. I would very much like to incorporate 3D modeling and the guitar and accordion alongside drawing if it works, and have some time for myself to play videogames, or maybe also relax with a book or go for a walk or so. I plan on having workout as a part of my daily ritual as well. 

Basically, how I see it, we only get one life to live. I want to live it to the fullest, being happy, and doing things I enjoy for a living, creating worlds and stories, filling them up with life and music, and sharing with others to enjoy. I really hope you guys can help me.

Organize and Track the Things I Love,"Not sure if this fits here but.....

I’m a guy that likes to keep track of everything.   I’m am organizing junkie. I use Foursquare to track the places we have been, a brewery app and winery app to track those places.

We love cheese, we love salsa, we love cured meats.  We love food.

For instance an album that was called “cheese” and the ability to sort/filter by ratings and tags.   For instance all the 5 star cheddars. I would like the app to sync between my iOS devices and also keep the photos outside of my other iOS photos so they don’t get cluttered.  Maybe there is a better way?

What are some ways to store camping equipment in an office without a closet?,"Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/xWWOVTE](https://imgur.com/a/xWWOVTE)

Create Meeting Locations with One Touch,"A little backstory, I'm a full-time university student. Last year I found myself consistently losing track of where I was supposed to be at any given moment and who I was supposed to meet with.

Between taking tests, meeting group members for projects, meeting my club for weekly meetings, and hanging out with my friends, I found myself misremembering where and when we were supposed to meet. Understandably, I was met with a lot of annoying glares when I finally showed up. 

I tried a lot of different tools to help with my disorganization. I tried Apple Calendar, which helped for a while, but it was oftentimes tedious constantly logging where I was going especially when I had to type in the address, an event, mark ""all-day"" or not, etc. Beyond that, simply telling people were were meeting at ""Building A"" often caused confusion as to which end or where we were meeting. My lazy bum quickly dropped using Calendar. 

I also tried using Wunderlist, a great to-do list, but not exactly the greatest at planning meeting locations either.

Seeing as though my dream product didn't exist in the market yet, I saw the opportunity to jump in and develop a product that at the very least I could use. 

10 months of learning iOS development later, I published MeetPoint, my own social scheduling app for the laziest of people.

After a painless facebook login, you create events on the app by holding a finger to the exact spot on the map you want to remember -- this could be an event for your club, for going to the bar after work, etc. After a quick title &amp; time input, it's automatically added to a chronologically-sorted schedule on the sidebar. 

After adding a few friends, you can quickly glance to see their real-time location (precision within literally meters), and have them ""join"" your event, thereby adding it to their own schedules. Now you can see exactly when and where you're meeting, as well as who's arrived and who hasn't.

I created this app with zero ads, zero other monetization plans, only to help others who may be struggling to schedule their social lives. That being said, it's a work in progress and I'm reworking the entire app using user feedback.

10 months of learning iOS development later, I published MeetPoint, my own social scheduling app for the laziest of people.

After a painless facebook login, you create events on the app by holding a finger to the exact spot on the map you want to remember -- this could be an event for your club, for going to the bar after work, etc. After a quick title &amp; time input, it's automatically added to a chronologically-sorted schedule on the sidebar.

After adding a few friends, you can quickly glance to see their real-time location (precision within literally meters), and have them ""join"" your event, thereby adding it to their own schedules. Now you can see exactly when and where you're meeting, as well as who's arrived and who hasn't.

I created this app with zero ads, zero other monetization plans, only to help others who may be struggling to schedule their social lives. That being said, it's a work in progress and I'm reworking the entire app using user feedback. I'm also developing an android version in my spare time!

(iOS)

Thanks for reading, if you would like to test my app and provide some (hopefully constructive) feedback below I'd love to hear it.",0

Looking for an app to help me schedule personal projects,"So I have a lot that I'm working on in my spare time: learning a new language, writing a screenplay, my excercise regime, I have LOTS on my reading list, and I work from home so I suppose that counts.

I'm looking for a simple, clean app (iPad preferably) that can help me schedule all these things. I have found plenty of daily to-do apps, but that isn't quite what I'm looking for. I want something to help me allocate time on a repeating weekly basis, but most importantly it needs to be FLEXIBLE. Like if I make plans with friends that would interrupt my usually scheduled writing, I want to easily re-schedule so that I don't simply ignore my writing.

Oh and if it's free then that's perfect, but I don't mind paying a couple of quid. Don't want anything I have to pay a subscription fee to though,

Looking for way to organize charging of multiple electronics on small nightstand,"Hi everyone - I can't believe I haven't found this reddit before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved into a new very small apartment and bought [this night stand](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/30388981/) from Ikea. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a glass pitcher with some fake flowers in it, a google home mini, and a qi charger for my personal iphone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I was gifted a kindle, and started using a work phone, AND purchased a nintendo switch and my partner and I decided to start charging our toothbrushes on our nightstands to prevent clutter from our very small bathroom sink countertop. 

&amp;#x200B;

As such I'm wondering if anyone has any organizing tips and tricks to organize charging cables for all of this:

\- iphone x (qi charger)

\- iphone 7 (lightning cable)

\- kindle (microusb) 

\- nintendo switch (usb-c)

\- toothbrush (usb)

Drawers for hall closet?,"I'm looking for something to organize medicine, bandages, etc.  I've been using a couple of large-ish shoeboxes without lids, but I could really use a little extra room.  Using more vertical space would help, so I'm thinking about drawers that can sit on a shelf.

Here's the tough part.  The drawers need to be about 5"" tall.  I have about 12.5"" inches between shelves, but almost 2"" of that has an overhang from the shelf above.  So the set of drawers can be taller than 10.5"", but the clearance for the drawers themselves needs to be within that shorter distance.  They probably need to be fairly wide, too.  Between the two boxes, we currently use more than 18"" of width, so having at least 10"" to work with would be fantastic.  Using most of of the 16"" depth of the shelf would be great, too.  Those are pretty specific requirements, I realize.

What I've done is stand the boxes on end, and label the ones that don't already identify themselves on the end.  I label the top of any pill bottles that aren't immediately recognizable, too.  If I just use a standing shelf, we won't be able to easily see everything and grab what we need.  Drawers would need to fully extend, too.

There are wire shelves in the closet, and I put foam board on top of them to keep a solid, flat surface.  It's an apartment, so I can't modify them much.  I can swap a couple of shelves around to get roughly an inch extra height, but that would (1) be a lot of work, and (2) make the things we use more often a little less accessible.

The Wardrobe Rules,"Building an easy close-to-home style is not as simple as it sounds. However, to uncomplicated the procedure you essentially need to:

figure out how to streamline your style with a case closet that spares time, cash, and vitality.

stick to an arrangement of rules that assistance you effectively keep up your mark look.

Here are my closet rules that will enable you to raise your style with a simple to execute process.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. RESPECT YOUR LIFESTYLE**

Once in a while we truly need to be what we're most certainly not. Also, every time we surrender to these unlikely wants we wind up settling on poor choices. Either change the life you live or acknowledge it, however do not mind yourself out.

Perusing Vogue publications or following a bundle of design bloggers is awesome for motivation yet the (somewhat showy) pictures they have a tendency to depict may not constantly fit with the truth of your everyday.

With regards to building your closet how you invest the vast majority of your energy ought to be the main influencer. Else you'll have a considerable measure of stuff that looks pleasant on holders however not on you.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. DRESS ONLY FOR YOURSELF**

Now and again it appears as though ladies, specifically, settle on style decisions so they can be appealing to men or the envy of other ladies. What's more, with the ascent of metrosexuals and men of honor's form, guys seem, by all accounts, to be sticking to this same pattern.

Yet, dressing for someone else is a noteworthy supporter of the pressure related with wardrobing. It is normal to mind what others consider you, yet when buying pieces or preparing every day their conclusion should not eclipse your own.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. MAKE DAILY UNIFORMS**

You ought to have a bunch of day by day uniforms that make it simple to pull together a look in around 5 minutes level, and your case closet ought to be involved a progression of these uniforms.

This is a superb style technique in light of the fact that at whatever point you are settling on a choice about what to wear (be it pressing for movement, an uncommon event, or only an ordinary day) you should simply choose one of the uniforms that applies to a specific occasion.

My regular uniform comprises of thin pants, tennis shoes or cowhide loafers, a slipover shirt, and a larger than usual overcoat. However, I likewise have a uniform that is material for the real exercises I take part in and it makes the way toward styling myself super proficient.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. DEPEND ON THE BASICS**

Regardless of your stylish (be it great or restless) you can profit by having a choice of staples that speak to the main part of your closet.

These staples (or nuts and bolts) are the essential components worth spending your cash on in light of the fact that they are things that can be worn all the more regularly.

Set aside the opportunity to decide the best staples for you, where to get them, and how to keep up them so they last.

Spending exertion on this fair more than once per year will totally dispense with the time you squander preparing all through whatever is left of the year.

When you have your staples set up, if you pick, you can adorn them with few extras or other more detailed clothing pieces that assistance you make a mark look.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. ORGANIZE YOUR COMFORT**

I seldom wear high foot sole areas since I discover them a torment to stroll in. No event will tempt me conflict with that administer in light of the fact that I know I would just think twice about it at last.

You too ought to have a point of confinement to how far you will go for the sake of mold. Thoroughly consider a portion of your most excruciating or shocking style minutes and make a strong responsibility to never go there again.

When you are not happy, you aren't sure. What's more, when you are not certain it demonstrates regardless of how costly, on pattern, or chic your outfit might be.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. GO FOR A SUBTLE STYLE**

Inconspicuously classy individuals have a charm since they are not really attempting to emerge, however, the nature of their look makes it difficult to disregard them.

That quality is most obvious on account of the reasonable consideration they've dedicated to fit and creation — not really on the grounds that they were stressed over brand names or patterns.

Being a mobile bulletin may stop people in their tracks yet it may not be on account of you look great — you aren't naturally an expert of style since you surged out to by the most recent it pack.

Focusing on how certain outlines supplement your body compose and figuring out how to choose well-made articles of clothing made from astounding materials will probably get you esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. PRACTICE DISCERNMENT**

By the end of this book, you will be able to discover fantastic ideas to live a minimalist lifestyle and enjoy life more. ",organization,1541260729,AuthorBrettSmith,0,1,True,9tv7er,2018-11-03,"The Wardrobe Rules Building an easy close-to-home style is not as simple as it sounds. However, to uncomplicated the procedure you essentially need to:

figure out how to streamline your style with a case closet that spares time, cash, and vitality.

stick to an arrangement of rules that assistance you effectively keep up your mark look.

Here are my closet rules that will enable you to raise your style with a simple to execute process.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. RESPECT YOUR LIFESTYLE**

Once in a while we truly need to be what we're most certainly not. Also, every time we surrender to these unlikely wants we wind up settling on poor choices. Either change the life you live or acknowledge it, however do not mind yourself out.

Perusing Vogue publications or following a bundle of design bloggers is awesome for motivation yet the (somewhat showy) pictures they have a tendency to depict may not constantly fit with the truth of your everyday.

With regards to building your closet how you invest the vast majority of your energy ought to be the main influencer. Else you'll have a considerable measure of stuff that looks pleasant on holders however not on you.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. DRESS ONLY FOR YOURSELF**

Now and again it appears as though ladies, specifically, settle on style decisions so they can be appealing to men or the envy of other ladies. What's more, with the ascent of metrosexuals and men of honor's form, guys seem, by all accounts, to be sticking to this same pattern.

Yet, dressing for someone else is a noteworthy supporter of the pressure related with wardrobing. It is normal to mind what others consider you, yet when buying pieces or preparing every day their conclusion should not eclipse your own.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. MAKE DAILY UNIFORMS**

You ought to have a bunch of day by day uniforms that make it simple to pull together a look in around 5 minutes level, and your case closet ought to be involved a progression of these uniforms.

This is a superb style technique in light of the fact that at whatever point you are settling on a choice about what to wear (be it pressing for movement, an uncommon event, or only an ordinary day) you should simply choose one of the uniforms that applies to a specific occasion.

My regular uniform comprises of thin pants, tennis shoes or cowhide loafers, a slipover shirt, and a larger than usual overcoat. However, I likewise have a uniform that is material for the real exercises I take part in and it makes the way toward styling myself super proficient.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. DEPEND ON THE BASICS**

Regardless of your stylish (be it great or restless) you can profit by having a choice of staples that speak to the main part of your closet.

These staples (or nuts and bolts) are the essential components worth spending your cash on in light of the fact that they are things that can be worn all the more regularly.

Set aside the opportunity to decide the best staples for you, where to get them, and how to keep up them so they last.

Spending exertion on this fair more than once per year will totally dispense with the time you squander preparing all through whatever is left of the year.

When you have your staples set up, if you pick, you can adorn them with few extras or other more detailed clothing pieces that assistance you make a mark look.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. ORGANIZE YOUR COMFORT**

I seldom wear high foot sole areas since I discover them a torment to stroll in. No event will tempt me conflict with that administer in light of the fact that I know I would just think twice about it at last.

You too ought to have a point of confinement to how far you will go for the sake of mold. Thoroughly consider a portion of your most excruciating or shocking style minutes and make a strong responsibility to never go there again.

When you are not happy, you aren't sure. What's more, when you are not certain it demonstrates regardless of how costly, on pattern, or chic your outfit might be.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. GO FOR A SUBTLE STYLE**

Inconspicuously classy individuals have a charm since they are not really attempting to emerge, however, the nature of their look makes it difficult to disregard them.

That quality is most obvious on account of the reasonable consideration they've dedicated to fit and creation — not really on the grounds that they were stressed over brand names or patterns.

Being a mobile bulletin may stop people in their tracks yet it may not be on account of you look great — you aren't naturally an expert of style since you surged out to by the most recent it pack.

Focusing on how certain outlines supplement your body compose and figuring out how to choose well-made articles of clothing made from astounding materials will probably get you esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. PRACTICE DISCERNMENT**

The majority of the guidelines above truly descend to my most loved and that will perceive about what you purchase, what you keep in your storage room, and what you choose to wear.

I adore the statement by Christine Koh ""consider yourself a guardian, as opposed to a buyer"" which gets at its core.

New home no storage - help!,"I’ll try to keep this short, but I’m not very good at that!
TL;DR New place is 2x as big with less than 1/4 of storage. I decluttered, but I don’t have anywhere to unpack the boxes to. Meanwhile we keep digging in the boxes for what we need.
We just moved to our first owned home from a teeny 1 bedroom apartment. I thought it would be easy to expand into the space, but instead I have boxes against walls.
The apartment had a bedroom closet, a 10ft long hallway closet, bathroom linen closet and a ton of kitchen cabinets. The house I moved into has 2 bedrooms, one master closet that is 90% water softener, 3 upper and 3 lower kitchen cabinets, and that’s it! No garage and no basement (crawlspace).
We have pantry items stored in clear totes under the breakfast bar type counter. My husband’s tool chest is in the corner of our bedroom and none of my crafts have anywhere at all to go (crafts like sewing machine and fabric for our quilted curtains I’m making.) The counter keeps filling up with stuff that we use and don’t get put back in the moving boxes. I can’t cook a meal without getting frustrated, even if I clean as I go.
I decluttered more than I should’ve already. The second bedroom is my baby’s. Everything that has a space is already put away. We plan to remodel, but that’s hard to do in a cluttered house.
All that considered, I still am looking for sanity right now. I work from home to be available to care for my child and it’s so distracting and stressful to see this crap everywhere all day long.
Does anyone have any ideas on where to start? I’m willing to buy temporary storage solutions even if it’s not permanent. Also happy to read articles, but I’m struggling to find ones that aren’t saying to declutter more. I’ve always wanted to get fully organized, but I lost a lot of progress when we moved.

What do you put in cabinets above the fridge?,"There are some small cabinets above the fridge and another set above the built-in Microwave.

However, due to the size of the fridge and position of the other cabinets and counter, I can't reach anything inside the ones over the refrigerator unless I do a balancing act on the corner of the kitchen counter or use a step ladder.

Need help organizing a messy bathroom,"My teens share a bathroom. It’s a humongous mess. Their jewelry, makeup, cleaning products, contact lens stuff, you name it. They also go to their dad’s every other week. They are very good, very active kids. I could go all militant about the cleanliness and make them clean it. But I don’t agree with that approach for various reasons. Their life is very hard right now and I want to make it a bit easier for them. I know they appreciate clean space. I’ve asked. Bringing in a cleaner doesn’t exactly work because I need to organize the space first (tidying before cleaning.) 

Two kids sharing the bath. The room has two sinks. It’s an average sized bathroom with decent amount of storage under the sinks, three drawers in the middle and a very small medicine cabinet. Any ideas on how to organize it? Thank you.

[Advice] Need help with shoe storage,"I have been storing my occasional use shoes in my closet, and it is only 8 boxes.  I need to find some way to store them besides stacking them on the floor.  I do have a small closet (think a closet that might be in a spare room, not at all like the usual master room sized walk in closet) and i only have the boxes of shoes, 2 clear large storage bins, current laptop box, current tennis shoe box, and a backpack on the ground.  I wear these during the appropriate season, so they are worn.  I've sold about 6 pairs so far and donated about 6 other pairs already.   


The box measurements are below (smallest to biggest-ish) (I don't know if they matter): (MEASUREMENTS ARE DEPTH * LENGTH * HEIGHT)

"[Advice] Closets galore, not sure how to best use them","Hello all, 

Recently moved into my first apartment. One bedroom 628 sq ft, and FIVE closets!!! (Maybe it’s normal, but it seems excessive to me). Prior to this, all of my stuff was in my 150 sq ft room at my old apartment where I live with roommates (I don’t have anything at my parent’s house as they moved when I went off to college). I managed this by putting everything in the white tubs at Target that you can label with white board erasers and putting them under my very tall bed frame. I put the stuff I would want to access least frequently (e.g. I have a box with elementary and middle school memories) in the back corner and the stuff I would want to access more frequently (e.g. summer/winter clothes, games, and softball gear) in the boxes nearest the edge of my bed. All of my boxes with all of my stuff are here, sitting in the living room, waiting to be put away.

While I’ll keep some of the more memories-based stuff tucked away in a box or two, I’d like to organize the rest of it throughout my closets. I have a LOT of office supplies and papers and notebooks and books (graduating this year with two bachelors degrees). Lots of clothes I need to sell, a bunch of hobby-related items (old gaming systems), stuff from trips I’ve taken to Kenya, Turkey, etc., personal hygiene stuff and more.

I’m looking for suggestions specifically on...

1. General bathroom organization. I’m not a huge makeup (although I do have some) person, but I have some hair dyes and a good amount face washes/lotions/etc. I use for different times of year. I have 5 drawers in my bathroom and a whole linen closet that has five shelves for things.

2. I have two closets - one by my front door and one in my room, that are 7-8ft x 2 ft, have two upper shelves with a rod for hanging clothes under. Since I have hooks on the back of my front door for coats and such, I’d like for all of the closet by the door and part of my bedroom closet to have more shelf space somehow, like the linen closet almost, so I can get some bins and containers and start organizing away. Ideas or other suggestions as far as how to create shelf space (I’m renting, so I can’t be drilling away) or containers? I’d like to keep it relatively cheap, but if there’s something that will last and is versatile, I’m willing to save for it.

Organization Advice,"Hola!  


I was hoping for some help generating ideas on better organizing my space. Currently, I have a small bedroom that doubles as my office. My queen bed takes up about half the room, with my desk sitting right beside it. The only other furniture in the room is my bookshelf, which is jam packed.

Now that I have purchased a full monitor/keyboard set up for my desk, I've lost quite a bit of surface area. I definitely won't be able to fit any more furniture.  


Currently I'm thinking that I will need to sell my desk in favor of one with drawers for the keyboard/mouse, etc. Perhaps buy mountable shelving to organize my files on the wall, rather than taking up more space with tabletop methods.

Looking for an app or program or alarm clock that can run a set of alarms at any time.,"Basically the title.  


Here is some explaining if the title is unclear:  


I have ADHD. This means I have great difficulty choosing what to do and focusing on multiple tasks at once. I have a few things that I do every morning: meditate, breakfast, getting dressed, making myself ready, packing my bag etc. But I keep forgetting steps or spend too much time on one task or trying to decide what to do next. I also have no time perception, so I will spend two hours on just getting ready on bad days. I was late to class almost every day last week, even though I got up two hours before I needed to head out the door. It is exhausting and overwhelming for me.  


To solve this, I would like to have different sets of alarms that go off when I decide to do my morning routine. I don't wake up every day at the same time (sometimes if differs an hour, sometimes one and a half and I sleep in on sunday). I also don't want to think about it too much, and I can't oversee having more than 30 alarms on my phone that take into account every possible beginning of my day.  


My problem with regular alarms is that I have to manually alter all different alarms to make them match up. I can set timers to go off with regular intervals, but the different steps take different amounts of time.  


It's a bit like the 'brain focus' app, but with more elements instead of just the 'study' and 'break' options.  


for example:  


alarmset 'morning routine'  
Get dressed - 5 minutes  
Eat breakfast - 10 minutes  
meditate - 20 minutes  


Is there such an app? I have tried looking it up but it either seems that my question is so obvious that no one felt the need to ask it,   


Preferably something that I can use on my android phone but I will try anything!

Here is some explaining if the title is unclear:  


I have ADHD. This means I have great difficulty choosing what to do and focusing on multiple tasks at once. I have a few things that I do every morning: meditate, breakfast, getting dressed, making myself ready, packing my bag etc. But I keep forgetting steps or spend too much time on one task or trying to decide what to do next. I also have no time perception, so I will spend two hours on just getting ready on bad days. I was late to class almost every day last week, even though I got up two hours before I needed to head out the door. It is exhausting and overwhelming for me.

Task/scheduling app to make sure you're staying on task with periodic reminders?,"Hello all, recently I started doing some freelance work on a site that requires hourly freelancers to use their own proprietary desktop app to track time. The app is really great because it prompts you to write a brief description of what you're doing, then you can set an interval for the app to remind you about what you're doing. When it reminds you, you can either click to confirm you're still doing what you described which dismisses the reminder (or it disappears after a brief interval), or you can click the reminder popup to quickly edit the description of what you're doing.

I've actually found this keeps me very organized and on task. When I slip into reading a news site or blog post, the reminder popup becomes incredibly helpful.

How to organize my notes?,"Not exactly about physical organization, but organization of notes and drawings into a  journal. My organizational skills needs help :(. 

I am looking to organize my own personal notes. I am doing this for shoemaking. This is my inspiration https://fashionary.org/collections/all/products/shoe-design-fashionary.

the shoes I want to make are Japanese style. The mindset of their crafts are super structured learning. Sushi apprentices only make the rice and egg desert for an entire year. They also catalog in their minds all the knowledge so they can go levels beyond any one. Their knife making, sushi making, and wood working all are miles apart from the next competition.

What I thought I would do is to do to the point documentation on how to make a boot. A dress shoe, flats, heels loafers, so on. I would like to document the type of leathers and drawings of the foot moulds as all these shoes have different requirements.

In shoemaking there are different steps called pattern design, lasting, welting, bottoming, edge finishing. I would like to document these steps in my own words in another chapter.


What I would like to do also  is to  take square cut outs of different leathers, paste them into a book so I can see them all in one place.Different types of stitches. Different types of construction.

Another chapter for advanced techniques.

Organize ~90 stores utilities and online log-ins by store or by utility company?,"I feel like this is a doozy to explain but I will try my best:

I'm wanting to set up a spreadsheet for our AP department to track monthly bills. There are about 90 stores under multiple LLCs. Each store has at least 3 utilities but some have 5 or 6 depending on how water, electric, and phone/TV/internet are set up and whether or not we are billed for trash pick up. 

The information I want on hand is:

* utility company and what it's for (some have generic names like ""City of [name]"")

* general billing and due dates

* which payment cycle they're in (we have 2 per month)

* the associated account number

* any PIN or passphrase needed to check on services over the phone

* online login info (username, password, security question answers)

I have the data compiled across 5 different files and would like to combine them into one or two:

I currently have an Excel spreadsheet with just the log-in info but it's clunky and inefficient. The workbooks are organized by the parent company (the 90 stores are very unevenly dispersed across ~10 LLCs). To complicate things, only a handful of companies allow you to have multiple accounts associated with one log in, and many of the stores have unique utilities that are not shared by any other store, so there are workbooks with 50 logins and some with one or two. 

I also have 4 word documents:

* utility account numbers that are under utility company names with sub-categories for each LLC https://i.imgur.com/hAM4xxG.jpg

* each LLC listed with utility type underneath and each company we use under that, and the store number next to the company https://i.imgur.com/lHSb9wE.jpg

* utilities paid with the check run on the 1st (set up like above) https://i.imgur.com/ZwsWLn4.jpg

* utilities paid with the check run on the 15th (set up like above)  https://i.imgur.com/eXR3X7W.jpg

I am willing to concede to keeping the online login info either on a different worksheet or in a different file all together and just have a yes or no under a ""log in?"" column as it's hard to track which have log in and which don't. Unfortunately I can't make log ins for all of them for reasons out of my control. 

Anyway, I'm feeling stuck and could use a little help. I normally took care of all of these but we've taken on too many LLC clients and their bills as a result, and my AP department is brand new and still just learning our data entry procedures and I'd like to have this done by the end of the week, not weeks/months from now.

Into what container should I dispose of wet toilet wipes? (Suggestions requested; maybe think outside the box?),"Hi. Most people I know dispose of wet toilet wipes directly into the toilet, but that seems bad for the sewer lateral and the city's sewer system in general.

Please help me come up with ideas to dispose of wet wipes. I'm thinking a size of 1.5 to 2.5 gallon would be best, but am not positive. Ideally, the solution isn't expensive - around US$15 or less.

After a few weeks of thinking, I only came up with the following, and they aren't perfect:

* **Compost bin**. Issue: Not airtight, so the smell will escape.
* **Kitchen food airtight storage container**. Issue: Virtually all of them are transparent, so people can see the wipes.
* **Pet food storage container**. Issue: Transparent.
* **Diaper pail**. Issue: Not sure yet; I just thought of this today! Looks like most are step-on-to-open, which may be awkward while sitting on the toilet. And they all seem to use special bags, which would be pricey.

About to start uni and need help with note organization system,"I dont live in the US. Just putting this here in case it becomes relevant

Im going to study psych for 5 years in abt a month. Ive got everything under control with housing and the schedule. So now i just have the ""small"" stuff left. Im pretty picky about how I do things, especially when its sth new to me. Im trying to come up with a system of taking notes so I wont lose my mind mid-term if I havent managed to find a solid system. So far this is what I have:

**Flash cards:** practice for exams/general revision; info from books and lectures; question on one side, answer on the other; acronym for course at the top right corner; color coded based on which semester it is (too many separate courses, not enough colors)

**A5 spiral notebook:** lecture notes; course name, lecturer, and date on the first line

**Any notebook:** notes from textbooks; chapter name and/or number at the top and then just take chill notes per usual

My questions:

1. Is it a good idea to have one notebook for only lectures? Id rather not have a single one for each course, but I still want some insight on whether one notebook for lectures in general is a good idea. 
2. Is A5 too small? Mine is pretty thick for its size. 
3. Is it too much with both flash cards and a notebook for note-taking from textbooks? I know my schedule will be hella hectic, so is this realistic? I tend to make way too ambitious plans so Id like some insight on this as well.
4. If I do end up taking notes from textbooks on a regular basis, should I have one separate notebook for each course? Or should I just have one notebook and see how many courses fit in it and get new notebooks as required? 

Sorry if I sound a bit crazy. Ive just always been extremely anal about how I take notes ever since I began to take school seriously. Having a solid system that I can rely on, i.e. one that wont make me go ""shit, where do i write this, should i even write it, its important info but i have no place to write it so i wont write it"", means a lot to me.

Struggling with Email organization,"I'm struggling to get on top of organizing my email. I'm a System Admin that does consulting as well. I get emails for just about everything and have no idea how to organize them. I've tried organizing by subject matter, by vendor/client, by project, by users, etc and there is always some outlier that doesn't fit in any.

Looking for a filing system similar to FreedomFiler that will ship to me in the UK without costing me a kidney,"I desperately need to get my files organized and I'm definitely won over by [FreedomFiler](http://freedomfiler.com).

Woodworking/vehicular-Based Garage Constantly Messy (Due to someone else),"Hey everyone,

I am a 22 year old living with my family, I kind of tried to adopt the garage as a project workstation and have done [some things to keep the mess on the down low:](https://imgur.com/Z8CucXc)

\- Moved all sporting and gardening equipment (including salt) to a shed that we built for our landscaping accessories.

\- Snapon box with general hand tools, shelves don't have dividers but I have a layout that i more or less like

I'm not really sure how a multi-purpose is supposed to work and I never could really fill my wall up with stuff.

I used to be able to keep it decently clean, however I share the garage with my dad and being that I've spent thousands on my collection, he prefers to use it, but he cannot put things back where he found them. It feels like he thinks it's like the [magic coffee table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_kXIGvB1uU). If I am not using my garage for a month I'll come back to a total mess which is totally demoralizing. I've tried making things harder for him to reach or in such a level organization that he has has to maintain the status quo, but nothing. 

So I'd like a system that idiot-proof, that he doesn't have to choose where things go. I figure that has something to do with my wall, but I like getting tools from my box.

Since my projects are multi-media, what is the best approach for this kind of issue? We're going to be renovating our bathroom soon so I'd preferably like to get it done before then...

I would LOVE to display my china in it, but we have 4 cats and 3 small kids with limited space.  This is in the main living area of our house, and china would get destroyed.  
We currently have coloring books in several of the drawers, and I'm looking for attractive baskets/boxes to store crayons/markers/etc. in, as well as other general kid crafting supplies on the lower shelves. the shelves have about 9.5 in. clearance top to bottom (accounting for all trim), and about 5 feet across.  This unit is MASSIVE, and i need it to look attractive and neat, or our main living space suffers.
I still haven't figured out what to use the top spaces for, but the large doors will store extra blankets and pillows, and maybe a basket in the one nearest the door with winter gear (gloves, hats, scarves).
Any ideas, product recommendations, etc. are welcome.

"Organize a lot of cables, batteries and skews","Hey guys,

This is my first activity on reddit so please be kind with me.

I am thinking for a while how I can organize my cables batteries, skews and other small stuff which I collected over the time. I'm not collecting trash it is just about things I think I really need.

Here are some examples for my ""cable collection"":

\- Network cables aka RJ45 aka CAT5/5e/6 (in different colors and length)

\- USB cable: A to B, C to C, A to C, A to micro USB, A to macro USB

\- Display cables: HDMI, DVI, VGA (just one for legacy cases), SCART (also just one\^\^) and some cinch

\- Some special PC cable for my mainboard

\- TV cables (with F connector)

\- Power strips

Some battery types I own:

\- A, AA, AAA, C, D

\- Lots of that funny coin shaped like CR2032 and so on (for remotes, watches and whatever)

And for sure skews, I cannot name them, but you can imagine it. I have them in small boxes, but I am always searching for the right type (primary length) and of cause their counterparts like wall plugs or nuts.

Do you have a cool structure to sort those kind of stuff? I'm sick of searching parts or untangling cables. I want a quick and wife proof solution :-D",organization,1530909324,HomeNerd,20,8,True,8wnh94,2018-07-06,"Organize a lot of cables, batteries and skews Hey guys,

How to Deal with Unorganized People?,"So I'm a very organized person, messy things make me crazy and I'm good at sorting them out. My parents, on the other hand, are very messy. They don't care about clutter, they actually embrace it. My mom was even talking about how she hates putting things in drawers and they both prefer to just pile everything on their nightstands instead of trying to organize it, and how she's ""ok with that"" and doesn't plan on changing it, ever. She says it's just the way she is and she's not gonna change herself. Well that's fine if they do that in their bedroom, but what's driving me crazy here is the kitchen. Every day I find myself reorganizing the cabinet and every time I fix it they mess it up. I have everything neatly placed but they never put anything back in place. They take chips off the top shelf and shove it on the middle shelf when they're done. They take out their coffee and don't bother pushing it back to keep the space in front of it. They do the same thing with milk in the fridge, leaving it at the very front of the shelf instead of pushing it to the back in the empty space it should go in. They shove bread into the area for cans. They don't even TRY to put things back right. And it's not like my methods are complicated. It's pretty obvious the way I've sorted things, all the pasta is in one spot, all the cans in another, the chips on the top shelf, everything has a very clear area. I showed it to her after I first organized (this is a new house so I thought if I started it with good organization they'd help keep it up) and she was just like ""yeah it looks great"" and then continues to shove things in whatever random spot without even looking. It's making me crazy. Veggies go in the damn crisper drawer! Condiments go in the door! Its not hard! Does anyone have any advice for this? I can't stand how messy they are but I can't keep reorganizing the entire kitchen every single day because they can't be bothered to put things in the right spot.

Storing books in shop or garage,"I have a large collection of RPG books — larger than my wife will let me keep in the house — and I’m trying to figure out the best way to keep them. 

Presently, they are on bookshelves in my detached wood shop, but the shop isn’t climate controlled and the pages are starting to warp. I live in the CA Central Valley, so we get temperatures peaking in 110s during the summer.

* I've got loads of clothes in various sizes. I have gained weight over the past 2 years due to depression and stress but have loads of designer and expensive clothing in smaller size. It does not fit but the quality is amazing and of course there is the cost. It's all classic and timeless pieces so not sure what to do.

* So much hair junk - ties, pins, curling irons, clips, bands, 
* makeup makeup makeup - I don't really wear much day to day but I like options when I do want to wear it. 

I feel like I do have a bit of the hoarder mentality in that I don't want to toss it incase I need it - I don't like wasting money - or if I owned it, tossed it and then needed it - it wouldn't be on hand anymore. I know that's a bad mentality but how do I overcome it?

Does anyone have any ideas for storage in a fairly small one\-bedroom apartment with little storage? I'm thinking of getting a small hutch that can be used for these supplies and also double as a toy cubbie of sorts for my dog's massive collection of toys and treats, haha.

Improve storage of DVD collection,"My husband and I own a lot of movies. They’re currently on shelves, alphabetized by title and catalogued in an app so we know exactly what we have. We have several sets of tv series that came very poorly packaged. They’re in a large plastic box and each disc is in a separate paper sleeve, then the sleeves are stacked on top of one another. Eventually, we’ll just digitize everything and save some space, but not just yet. Does anyone have any ideas to improve the storage of these poorly packaged series until we do?

How do I schedule in relaxation time and exercise into a college student's schedule?,"Hello.  I struggle with relaxing.  I can focus on work when I work, but when I do leisure activities, I am always under stress and find that I need to have a textbook open or my laptop editor open.  I have found that this is now messing with my focus when I work.   How should I plan rest and relaxation into my daily life?  How do I also plan in exercise?  Let us take my schedule:

6:30 a.m.: Wake up

7:40 a.m.: Leave for work

8-5 p.m.: Work -&gt; Sometimes, I do school work and other projects during this time.

5:30 p.m.: Reach home and eat dinner.  Try to unwind.  However, this is where my issue lies.  I can't unwind.  I am always under stress.  I try to exercise as my relaxation activity, but I usually spend ten minutes in the gym.  If I go with someone else, I can spend more time.

A couple of things I have noted: I am an extrovert.  I need to be with other people.  I prefer to be with other people my age and of my gender.  I find that as I do not have many friends who are my age and of my gender, I rely on social media to feel fulfilled.  I spend more time on social media, which makes me stressed out.  My ideal relaxation activity is one where I spend time with people of my age, who are women, and is more verbally oriented.  It also needs to be on a weekly basis.  I need to have a separate time set for daily exercise that cannot be counted as a relaxation activity.

Good relaxation activities:

\- I really have no clue.

\- Chess -&gt; I feel like I can talk with the other person and not focus on the game save on strategy.  

Bad relaxation activities:

\- Gym exercise -&gt; I do cardio and weights.  I used to be more regimented, but I have started to not do well as a result of not relaxing.

\- Social media -&gt; Eye strain, lack of human connection, etc.

\- Spending time with my men friends.  -&gt; It is starting to become awkward because the situation always devolves into the person saying that they like me and me being extremely uncomfortable.  

\- Fantasy games -&gt; Not really into roleplaying. 

\- Any type of activity I consider to be work: Writing blogs, writing articles, solving rigorous, proof based problems, interacting with my family, going to church, doing chores, etc.  These are essential activities, but not ones I enjoy.

Pantry drawer-ganization,"I consider myself to be pretty good at organizing things, but this one has me stumped. 

Moved into a new home and the previous homeowners redid the kitchen with Ikea cabinets. Since there wasn't a pantry before this, they added one in the form of an [Ikea SEKTION](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S29038535/) cabinet. It is 15"" wide and 24"" deep, and instead of shelves comes with 5 drawers in the bottom section, and they also added wire basket drawers to the top 3 shelves.

I'm a big fan of pantry organization and have my main items (flour, sugar, nuts, etc.) in glass Ball mason jars.

Tips for storage and organization in deceptively small house?,"My SO and I rent a townhouse, two floors and a basement. It's fairly decently sized compared to what I'm used to, but it seems like the more important areas for space ended up with less space. The closet is pretty shallow with two very short rods on the right and left only as long as the depth of the closet. I got those vertically collapsing space saving hangers, 5 on each side, and it still feels cramped and cluttered. The bathroom has just enough room to add an over the toilet shelving unit and a trash can but needs so much more help. And the kitchen...y'all, the kitchen hurts my soul. We have a pretty large open area for the living and dining room, so we put up a standing pantry shelf in there which tackled a lot of the food problem, and we also got a rolling 3 tier cart that *just* fits in the corner which took care of some pantry overflow and such, but there is such a depressingly small amount of counterspace. Even looking at organization stuff online, different items that can up space and storage, we don't even have the space to increase our space. I'm really just at a loss. And to make things worse, it seems like wall mounted stuff could be the cure for most of it, but with renting, thats pretty well out of the question. No shelves for the bathroom, no secured widthwise rods for the closets, nothing at all for the kitchen, I could use every bit of advice I could get so I even know where to start in increasing space and downing on clutter.",organization,1529352856,catamongthecrows,7,16,True,8s2nhr,2018-06-18,"Tips for storage and organization in deceptively small house?

Struggling At Work Due To Organization,"Hi all. I'm hoping to get some helpful input here!

I work in music, specifically as a ""talent buyer"" which means I book the artists. I am basically a junior buyer, and I have a boss who books the bigger artists, but I am looped into every conversation. 

For every email we get, I either need to place dates on a calendar, clear dates on a calendar, draft an offer, or make a note to follow up in a few weeks with this artist. The tasks are simple enough, and I'm great with the judgement stuff. 

However the job also requires me to book my own shows and be very independent in that sense, so I need to juggle my own booking with my bosses, not to mention we have multiple calendars for different venues, and book a music festival. I work crazy hours, and it's a ton of work. 

I struggle with the minor things. I will forget to remove dates from a calendar when a booking agent emails my boss to say ""we are passing"". It would be easy if my only job was to keep up with our emails, but I'm taking calls, and doing meetings and working on my own booking. I do have a document to keep track of things, but it is incredibly time consuming.

I previously had an assistant at an old job who was good at reminding me to do this, but I am not really cut out for this assistant type of work and I really need to make an improvement.

Recommendations for under-desk adhesive hooks (for purses/bags)?,"I’m overhauling my desk and would like recommendations on a sturdy hook to hang my purse + additional bags. Right now they just live under my desk in a pile.

Ideas for organizing physical photos,"My mother (age 75) has accumulated a lifetime of printed photos, I offered to help her organize them but have no idea where to start. She currently has them in one of those large plastic storage bins, mostly loosely thrown in. There are hundreds, dare I say 1000+, so photo albums really wouldn't be ideal as I'd estimate she would need 20 or more large albums. On top of the fact that she'd need so many albums, many are not standard sized photos with some being 5x7 and 8x10 portraits, some in announcement type cards, etc, so each of these would use up an entire page of the album and I doubt the 8x10s will fit at all. 

I searched through this sub and one suggestion was to digitize them, which I may do at some point, at least to some of them. But even if I did that mom would still want to keep the physical photos. 

I thought about getting some of those nicer decorative storage boxes and sorting the photos by decade but that's still just piling them in together, only in smaller piles. Is there any better way?

Google Calendar alternative?,"Hey everyone!

So first, quick background:
My google calendar has started deleting events (horrifying, I'm sure you can all sympathize) so I am looking around ASAP for an alternative.

I've been looking at the offline version of google calendar, but from what I read, it appears to be limited in functionality.

I want an offline version that doesn't sync or anything. It is personal, not something I use to see other peoples' events or share mine with others.

I want to be able to click and drag events and view multiple days at a time, at least.

I tried Rainlendar, and the interface isn't suitable for me.

I have a busy schedule and I often have to move around events, so being able to click and drag events is crucial if I don't want to spend all day on my calendar app. I also need to be able to move those events to the next day.

A task list is secondary but also quite important.

Im stumbling around to find a Softwaretool for my private organisation. On my journey i found this sub, and i think this is exactly the kind of stuff for this place.

My Problem:
I have a lot of things to manage at the moment. So i feel the urge to have a more efficient organization for the things im doing and keep them sorted.
Just keeping my calender and files up do date isnt enough anymore. I need a softwaretool that helps me to care about the right things at the right time.

I know there is software out there for customer relation management (crm) that can handle ""cases"".
A case consists of ""notes"" where everything that has been done is written down and a ""follow up"" date that states the time where i have to react and do the next step for this project. In adition there can be various fields that help you with ""todos"", ""contacts"" or ""appointments""

My questions is. Do you know an Online Softwaretool that can provide this?

Need advice for organizing a robotics club's full kit.,"Hey all, I'm here asking you all for advice on how we should organize our full kit of parts. Our team competes in the Vex Robotics Competition and as such we have a huge need for organization. At the moment we have two shelves and about 20-30 regular sized drawers that have been used in an attempt to organize but seem to have gone to the wayside when we reached the height of our season. I'm willing to speak with my coach about getting more organizers, bins, etc. if that would give us a better advantage in that aspect. Anyway, now that our season has begun to wind down we were going to tackle the issue of organization again. This time though I'd like to make it to where it's easy for everyone to use and won't be pushed aside during our next season as the previous system was.

Suggestions for moving in with SO,"Hi all!

I'll likely be moving in with my boyfriend in a few months, and one difficulty from the beginning is that I'm moving into his already established (and already full) house. He has a son and 2 roommates (one of whom has a child also). We've started ""spring cleaning"" one room a weekend to get rid of all the unnecessary clutter we can but it's still going to be a squeeze to shove myself in there too.

Does anyone have any tips/tricks/products that you've found useful when ""merging lives""? I already have an apartment full of stuff and while I'm not going to bring everything I don't want to have to throw out too much and can't really afford or legitimize renting a storage space.

So far I'm going to get space bags so I can store as much of my off-season or infrequently worn clothes which will be a life saver with closet space.
